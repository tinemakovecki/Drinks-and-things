                <h5 class="media-heading">Pairing Wine</h5>

                <p> 
				The reference for pairing wine with food was taken from this picture. 
				While it does include a lot of information it can't say everything. 
				One of the guidelines to pairing wine is that you should try to select 
				a wine from the country where your food originates from. Another tip is
				that white wine is lighter and to be paired with lighter foods like green 
				vegatables and fish. Whereas red wine can be paired with heavier, fattier foods, 
				like red meat, etc. Choosing to pair otherwise, for example fish with red wine
				is only suggested when the fish are heavier/more fatty or the wine is very light.
                </p>
				
				<p>
				There are other nuances to matching food with wine, far too many to be mentioned 
				here, but the most importnat thing is to try out different combinations. 
				Learn about them and find your personal preferences along the way.

                <h5 class="media-heading">Pairing Beer</h5>

                <p>
				For beer we included many different sources in order to define the 
				suggestions for this application. The pairings aren't quite as definite 
				as with wine. You can choose to pair beer based on different qualities.
				A match can be selected because the food and beer are similar, for example,
				smoky beer goes well with smoky food. Or you can try to find a contrast 
				between the food and bber, a beer with a strong taste, perhaps an IPA,
				to cut through the flavour of greasy food.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				An important guideline when matching beer is to balance the pairing.
				If the flavour of the beer is too strong it can easily overpower the
				food you're eating. On the other hand you also don't want a beer with 
				a taste too gentle to enjoy next to heavier food. Of course, again,
				experimentation and finding your personal prefrences is key.
