France;"Michel Guignier is a fourth generation vigneron in Villié Morgon, in the heart of the AOC Morgon appellation in Beaujolais. Following in the footsteps of the famed “Gang of Four” in Morgon, Guignier is committed to producing wines in the most natural way possible in order to both protect the environment and create wines that are alive and transmit a sense of place. He is in the process of slowly converting his estate to full organic certification, though has been planting grass and herbs between the rows as well as ploughing and composting for many years.The Morgon appellation is characterized by soils of decomposed granite and crumbly schist referred to regionally as “rotten rock”. Many of Guignier’s vines are up to 70 years old, all are tended by hand with yields kept to a minimum. Guignier feels that when grapes arrive at the cellar at full physiological ripeness then you have everything you have to make a top wine. As such, grapes are picked entirely by hand and rigorous sorting is done both in the vineyard and in the cellar before the grapes go into cement vats for vinification.<BR><BR>Guignier follows a traditional vinification “à la Beaujolaise” with no de-stemming and with only indigenous yeasts used for the fermentation. The wines are macerated for 6-7 days for the Beaujolais and up to 14-15 days for his top Morgons. Guignier uses a vertical wooden press that slowly and gently presses the grapes. After pressing, most of his wines are returned to cement to finish their alcoholic and malolactic fermentations. His top cuvée, the Morgon “Bio-Vitis”, however, is raised in neutral burgundy barrels. The élévage is between 5 and 15 months depending on the terroir and the quality of the vintage. Vintages with more tender, forward fruit are bottled a bit earlier, while the more structured years receive a longer time in vat or wood before bottling. Guinier uses minimal doses of S02, though he prefers to add it after the malolactic rather that at bottling as he feels it integrates better into the wine. He also makes several cuvées for the French market that are made entirely without sulphur at all.<BR><BR>Guignier’s wines display that transparent, ethereal, soil-driven quality that makes naturally-made, top Beaujolais so unique and joyful to drink. Among them are a fresh and charming Beaujolais AOC made from 50 year old vines, a rich and well structured Morgon Vieilles Vignes from 60-70 year old vines, and the complex and seductive Morgon Bio-Vitis made exclusively from fruit from La Roche Pilée, a south facing vineyard of pure, decomposed rock located at the base of the Cote de Py.<BR><BR>Michel Guignier is clearly a rising star who will soon join the ranks of the many luminaries in the village of Morgon."" - Importer";Beaujolais;Red;11.54;12.5;2016 Michel Guignier Beaujolais;Gamay;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/100142/bottle/749465/original.png;violet,   rose petal,   oak,   smoke and   mushroom;0.75;cherry,   strawberry and   raspberry

France;"Domaine du Salvard has been a working domaine since 1898, through five hardworking generations of the Delaille family. Today, all forty-two hectares of vineyards are farmed by the capable brother team of Emmanuel and Thierry Delaille, with help from their father Gilbert. To our delight, they have carried on the traditions established by their ancestors, producing a true, classic Cheverny that is both simple and elegant. The Delaille brothers have focused their attention on growing fresh, lively Sauvignon Blanc, deeply rooted in the sand, clay, and limestone plains of northeastern Touraine. Pinot Noir, Gamay, and Cot constitute their red grape holdings, creating youthful reds with great aromatics. Gilbert and his sons have also made their own contributions to the heritage of the domaine, including the introduction of sustainable farming practices into the vineyards, as well as temperature-controlled vinification equipment to the winery. Until finally achieving A.O.C. status in 1993, Cheverny was widely regarded as one of the best V.D.Q.S. (Vin de Qualité Superieur) of the Loire. However, some argue that this A.O.C.-in-waiting designation was a political maneuver by the I.N.A.O. to keep Cheverny’s delicious, sprightly Sauvignon Blanc out of competition with the other more famous appellations of Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé. Kermit was the first to discover the charm and value of Cheverny back in 1978 when he imported the Domaine Jean Gueritte. He took on the Cheverny of Domaine du Salvard in 1992, a year before the status change in the appellation.

France;"Produced from vines over 75 years old situated on the prestigious hill “des Caves” in Chenas, this wine offers a lovely finesse and elegance.<BR><BR>Maison Kuhnel was established by Jean-Pierre and Georgette Kuhnel back in 1943.  Their beginning was quite modest: they possessed only 3.5 hectares of property located in Morgon and Beaujolais Villages.  Their Morgon vineyard is in fact the oldest of their properties, dating back to 1943 when the Kuhnels first planted there.  During their tenure, both the Moulin-à-Vent and Chénas were added to their holdings.<BR><BR>In 1973, Jean-Pierre and Georgette’s son André assumed management of the domaine.  After years of professional cycling, André decided to undertake a career change and immersed himself in the world of wine.  After earning his BEP, he spent many years perfecting his wine making craft, gradually gaining recognition and awards for his wines.  André was joined by his wife, Anita, in 1996.  Her arrival came after spending years as a professional cyclist on the European tour.  In fact, it was through professional cycling that the two met.  Now their energies and passions are entirely devoted to wine making.<BR><BR>Today, the estate covers an area of about 12 hectares within the areas of Beaujolais Villages, Moulin-à-Vent, Chénas, and Morgon.  The last 3 are among the finest of the 10 Grand Crus of Beaujolais. The Kuhnels are devoted to managing every facet of their production. They personally tend to their vines from pruning each individual vine to harvesting the grapes.  They are strict adherents to traditional techniques and standards.

France;Attaining cult wine status is not an easy feat, and certainly not when the odds are stacked against you. Laurent Vaillé has achieved what others thought impossible. Having spent his early career training under such masters as Jean-François Coche-Dury (Meursault), Gérard Chave (Hermitage), and Eloi Durrbach (Domaine Trévallon, Provence), he settled in the l’Hérault of the Languedoc and purchased his own land in 1989, near Aniane. In this area of the region, where the limestone is hard and abundant and the soil poor, no one thought he would ever have any success planting a vineyard on his plot of choice. Though it took dynamite and bulldozing to clear twice the amount of limestone, boulders, and glacial scree that is found in neighboring vineyards, he found a great terroir for his grapes. He did not have to look far to find ideal bud wood, either. He sourced his Syrah, Marsanne, and Roussane cuttings from Gérard Chave and his Cabernet from Domaine Trévallon. Laurent’s South-facing vines get very low yields, normally from twenty to twenty-five hectoliters per hectare. All are pruned in the gobelet style. The simultaneous restraint and power of his wines makes them ideal for aging. As for the skeptics, they are currently eating their words. His area of the Languedoc has since become known to produce some of the greatest wines in the region, with the new appellation of Terrasses du Larzac, of which he is technically part, reaping attention and praise. In his words, “Nature gave us a partition of land. It is up to us to interpret it.” -Importer;France;Red;104.99;13.5;2012 Domaine De La Grange Des Peres;blend;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/100754/bottle/750578/original.png;spice box,   cedar,   dark fruit,   vanilla,   toast,   smoke,   tobacco,   red fruit,   currant,   blackberry,   cherry,   cigar box,   thyme,   clove,   cinnamon,   black pepper and   mint;0.75;currant,   blueberry,   blackberry,   strawberry,   black currant,   dust,   leather,   cherry,   bell pepper,   olive,   asparagus,   spice,   ginger,   oak,   vanilla,   violet,   smoke and   toast

The grapes undergo cold maceration before being pressed. This gives them their beautiful watermelon pink color. The fermentation takes place under controlled temperatures and is exceptionally long, resulting in rosés that are both lively, fresh and full-bodied.

More precisely, it is located in Palazzolo dello Stella (UD) in Friuli Venezia Giulia (Italy). The farm has always been trying to reduce the impact on the environment of its activities, and it has recently made a further effort on this way, taking the best and advanced technologies: a photovoltaic power system has been installed on the roof and it supplies electricity to all the farm's facilities respecting the surrounding environment; a geothermal heating system and a wine production system which is very advanced and eco-friendly. For these reasons Massimo Bassani has chosen this pay off ""Naturalmente Isola Augusta"" (which can be translated as ""Naturally Isola Augusta"") to represent his philosophy of life, production objective and determination for a healthier world.<BR><BR>Renzo Bassani, Massimo's father, had the idea to produce high-quality wines in the 50s when he bought this property which had been founded in 1861. It was already located in Palazzolo dello Stella and its name was ""Isola Augusta"". At the beginning he bred cows, there were milking machines and the milk was made into cheese in a small cheese factory and then sold with the farm’s logo. Later he found under the sand some bottles of wine which had been hidden by the sharecropper and after having tasted their contents he decided to start wine production. After the second flood of the Tagliamento decimated the cows, Renzo believed it was fate: he gave up cattle-breeding and began producing high-quality wines. Renzo Bassani's project was to control every phase of the production, from the grape wine growing to the bottling in order to show he didn't cultivate grape wine just to sell it. In the '70s Luigi Veronelli, a journalist who determined the growth of the popularity of the Italian wines, and who has later become a good friend of the family, ""receiving some bottles of wine to taste and to judge, answered writing on an important newspaper, giving to our wines excellent marks"" says Massimo Bassani, in an account to Ercole Gino Gelso. Today, he thanks his father for this little but valuable jewel he inherited, and which he began to devote himself to in 1972, when he was studying at university to get a degree in law. Massimo Bassani, the present owner and farm's production responsible, in an interview given to Francesco Antonini for the review ""Friuli da bere"", says: ""My father came from Venice, and he was an insurer. He had been the president of important companies in Trieste [...]. Land and wine were his passion, then, one day he visited Isola Augusta and got charmed"".

Italy;Il Poggione is a Brunello superstar and a vintage like this reveals every reason why that affirmation is true. From the second the 2012 Brunello di Montalcino pours into the glass, you know you are in for something special. The wine is darkly saturated and rich in appearance. Absent are those slightly amber or browning hues you often get with Sangiovese in a hot vintage. Nor does the wine show flat or tired characteristics. Instead, the quality of fruit is vibrant and rich. This is a healthy, generous and exuberant Brunello with dark density and succulent fruit flavors that are followed by integrated spice and tobacco. The balance is impressive and one thing you get here is fresh acidity. This is not to be underestimated, because the acidity quota in the 2012 vintage across the appellation is not as high or evident as usual.

France;"Domaine Trapet Père et Fils is one of the greatest estates of Gevrey-Chambertin, with superb holdings in three of the top grand crus in the village and a legacy of great wines that dates back to their earliest days of estate bottling. While the family have been important vineyard owners in Gevrey-Chambertin since 1870, it was not until the 1960s that they began to bottle a majority of their production and offer their wines directly for sale to clients. Previously they had been one of the finest sources for top négociants in the region, including Maison Leroy and Maison Joseph Drouhin. By the late 1920s, Domaine Trapet had become one of the most important vineyard owners in all of Burgundy, as they were the single largest owner in the great vineyard of Chambertin at this time, as well as owning very large tracts of Latricières-Chambertin and Chapelle-Chambertin.<BR><BR>The domaine was known throughout much of its history as Domaine Louis Trapet, named after the founder, but in 1993, the estate’s vineyard holdings were split in half, as a new generation sought to make wines from their half of the family’s holdings. The result was the Louis Trapet estate being renamed as Domaine Trapet Père et Fils and run under the very sure hand of Jean-Louis Trapet. As was the fashion at many top estates in the 1990s, Jean-Louis used quite a bit of new wood for his top wines at that time, but has moved to using dramatically less starting in the early 2000s and is now making some of the greatest wines in Burgundy today. The vineyards have been fully farmed under biodynamic principles since 1996, and are 100% certified biodynamic as of 2009.<BR><BR>While the estate is best known for its three great grand crus, the quality at Domaine Trapet Père et Fils is simply outstanding up and down the hierarchy of their vineyard holdings. Their Bourgogne rouge is one of the best in Burgundy. The domaine also makes an outstanding example of Gevrey-Chambertin Villages, and an impressive lineup of premier crus to augment their portfolio. The domaine also owns parcels in three top premier crus: Clos Prieur, Les Corbeaux and Petite Chapelle. The Clos Prieur and Petite Chapelle plots are amongst the first that the Trapet family purchased in the late 19th century. They purchased Petite Chapelle in 1877, followed by Clos Prieur in 1893; the Trapet les Corbeaux parcel was purchased much more recently. Because these plots are relatively small, in vintages with tiny yields they are sometimes combined to make a wine named ""Cuvee Capita 1er Cru"".<BR><BR>Their outstanding bottlings of Grand Crus (Latricières-Chambertin, Chapelle-Chambertin and Chambertin) are crafted to really show off their underlying terroirs. Though they may not be as ""big"" or powerfully constructed as some of their other more flashy neighbors in the village, in terms of aromatic and flavor complexity, expression of terroir, and aging potential, Jean-Louis Trapet is certainly in the top eshelon of producers wines in Gevrey-Chambertin. Like the man himself, there is an elegence, grace and purity to the wines that is haunting and rare in Gevrey. He is again creating the soil-driven and absolutely pure wines of his father and grandfather’s era. These are aristocratic interpretations of some of Gevrey’s greatest terroirs, with an emphasis on pure red plum and black cherry fruit, notes of grilled meat, cocoa powder, lovely soil tones and a judicious framing of new wood.<BR><BR>The Bourgogne rouge and Marsannay will usually drink well when young, while the Gevrey AC can use a year or two to blossom and ages very well. Of the three premier crus, the Corbeaux is pure red fruit, spice and lovely soil tones, the Clos Prieur more black fruity and meaty in style and the Petite Chapelle one of the most elegant, deep and complex premier crus to be found in Gevrey. The Selectionées Capita bottling takes the best attributes of Clos Prieur and les Corbeaux and synthesizes them into a whole greater than their parts, and the three grand crus are pure magic. All in all, Domaine Trapet Père et Fils is today at the top of their game and Jean-Louis Trapet is fashioning wines that are as stunning as any in the great history of this long-time Gevrey superstar.<BR><BR>In addition to his Burgundy estate, Jean-Louis and his wife also produce wines from her family’s property in Alsace. Here they grow Riesling, Gewurztraminer, and Pinot Gris. These tend to be dryer-styled Alsace wines, and are also produced from biodynamically-farmed vineyards."" -Importer";Burgundy;Red;71.99;12.5;2015 Domaine Trapet Gevrey Chambertin Ostrea;Pinot Noir;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/100879/bottle/757695/original.png;barnyard,   cherry,   plum,   game and   tomato;0.75;ripe cherry,   plum,   strawberry,   raspberry and   mushroom

France;"""Before acquiring vineyards, Georges Delille trained as a sommelier in Paris.  In 1963, he bought what would become Domaine de Terrebrune, a property in Ollioules, just east of Bandol, framed by the Mediterranean and the mountain called Gros-Cerveau (Big Brain), dotted with olive groves and scenic views—an idyllic spot. During the years following the declaration of A.O.C. Bandol (1941), mass overhauling and reconstruction of vineyards were commonplace, and vignerons were eager to revive the noble Mourvèdre grape. Georges spent ten years just renovating the property; he terraced hillsides, refashioned the masonry, replanted vineyards following the advice of Lucien Peyraud, designated soils to lie dormant and regenerate, and built a new cellar. In 1980, his son Reynald joined him after finishing winemaking school, and together they launched their first bottled vintage of Domaine de Terrebrune, which Reynald named in honor of the rich, brown soils they farm.";Provence;Rose;26.99;13.0;2016 Terrebrune Bandol Rose;blend;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/100890/bottle/751571/original.png;"thyme

France;"Known for his amazing white wines, Michel Bardet makes this sole red from old vines in the Pommard premier cru site called Clos Blanc.

Red fruits, fresh herbs, minerals and violet tones abound, enjoy this anytime over the next 15 years.""-Importer<BR><BR> ""This could be one of the great domaines of Meursault, especially with its substantial holding of Les Perrières and the monopoly of the Clos des Perrières, purchased by the original Albert Grivault in 1879. He built up an estate of 15 hectares, though he subsequently gave his holding of Meursault Charmes to the Hospices de Beaune. Other vineyards were later sold, including a hectare of Clos de Vougeot in 1931, and today the domaine consists of six hectares across five appellations - perhaps soon to be four as they have applied to have their hectare of Bourgogne Blanc upgraded to Meursault. Another proposal to upgrade the Clos des Perrières seems unlikely to succeed (see under Meursault Perrières).<BR><BR>Michel Bardet, grandson of Albert Grivault, has been running the domaine along with his sister, but the reins are being handed on to his daughter Claire and son Henri-Marc. The management of the vines is in the hands of various tâcherons, i.e other vignerons who are paid for the job they do rather than as salaried employees. The whites are bottled just before the next harvest after being matured in 20% new wood for the premiers crus. The red wine is aged in total for 18 months, having been vinified without stems. Domaine Grivault’s white wines are generally regarded as of a very high calibre, and are described as having a bright, acidic nature with astounding levels of clear minerality, although these traits reach their peak only after several years of aging.<BR><BR>Rather than dealing with the vines directly, Michel employs tâcherons to handle the physical aspect of the winemaking.

Italy;"The wine is made using an innovative take on the 'ripasso' technique. Most of the grapes are vinified at harvest time, while the rest are set aside to partially dry. In January, the wine blended with the juice from the raisined grapes undergoes a second fermentation.<BR><BR>The vineyard surrounds Villa della Torre, a splendid masterpiece of Renaissance architecture now owned by the family, and produces a full-bodied red wine that has an ageing potential of at least ten years. The blend is the historic combination of Corvina and Rondinella with the addition of a small quantity of Sangiovese.<BR><BR>This wine is a deep ruby red and easily pairs with various Italian dishes, above all risottos, especially those flavoured with saffron, porcini mushrooms and pork; classic dishes such as pasta with Amatriciana and Carbonara sauces, baked lasagna, gnocchi with gorgonzola cheese and walnuts; grilled meats and roasts."" -Winery";Veneto;Red;16.09;13.9;2013 Allegrini Palazzo Della Torre;blend;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/101040/bottle/750564/original.png;chocolate,   mocha,   fig,   earth,   raisin,   cranberry,   plum,   asparagus,   green pepper and   red fruit;0.75;chocolate,   mocha,   fig,   earth,   raisin,   cranberry,   plum,   red fruit,   strawberry and   raspberry

United States;"This value Pinot Noir offering is a true Pinot Noir (100% varietal wine) sourced from two distinctly different vineyard locations: one from Monterey in the Central Coast and the other in Clarksburg near the Sacramento Delta. The cool coastal climate of Monterey is well known for its early morning fog and cooler temperatures allowing the grapes to mature slowly and maintain natural acidity. Clarksburg has the reverse trend weather-wise and enjoys early morning sunshine which is moderated by the early afternoon breezes from the San Francisco Bay. The maturation model and degree days is comparable and the fruit expresses it. The clones used are 2A, 115, 667 and Pommard 4. We feel the use of each of these plays an important role in the aroma and flavor profiles of the finished wine. This incredible value Pinot Noir is bright garnet colored and has perfect Pinot Noir perfume which jumps out of the glass with ripe Bing and Rainer cherry notes. The palate is very supple and fruit forward with crushed cherry and raspberry flavors which are backed by some generous vanilla and cocoa lactones from aging in French oak for 14 months. The wine finishes complete with balanced acidity and juicy cherries along without being alcoholic. This wine pairs well with soft cow’s milk cheeses and blue such as Stilton or Maytag. It is also a fine choice with steamed Sea Bass in a soy glaze served with sea salted fingerling potatoes and braised cabbage. Try it also with five spice duck or rosemary chicken.""

And yes, just like fashion they command monster prices based on their ""big"" alcohol, ""big"" flavors, and ""big"" bottles. But Frog's Leap Zin is different: you can't use this stuff to light your charcoal grill. Maybe it's that we found our early inspiration for Zinfandel from a different source — instead of reinventing Zinfandel, we looked to the past and the incredible Zins of the '40s and '50s. Those wines taught us the lessons that the old-timers knew: that field blends of Petite sirah, Carignan, and sometimes Napa gamay all picked at ripeness (not as raisins) added color, aromatics, and earthy complexity. In other words, the help of other varietals was needed to reveal the Zinfandel grape's true flavors. These principles form the foundation for our wine today.

The wine fermented in the original oak vats that are now some 140 years of age. There is no temperature control and malolactic was also in the vat. The wine was transferred to oak barrels where it slowly matured in their deep, humid caves for no less than six years. After this, it was bottled unfiltered after being fined with egg whites.

The Brunier family is legendary in its own right, having been rooted to the enigmatic plateau known as La Crau for over one hundred years. The wines of Vieux Télégraphe evoke the concept of terroir in its purest form: they reflect their dramatic climate, the rough terrain that defines the soil, their full sun exposure at a higher altitude, the typicity of the varietals with an emphasis on Grenache, and of course, the influence of their caretakers, the Brunier family. For many, La Crau is Châteauneuf-du-Pape’s grandest cru.<BR><BR>After years of closer study, La Crau proved to be a privileged vineyard site. At the extreme southeastof the appellation, a large three-meter trench in the vineyard reveals its stratifications, millions ofyears in the making. The layers show early alluvial deposits, limestone, silica, and a robust red clay(known as molasse) that has come to characterize this terrain. Sitting on the surface of the soil, thegalets hold important functions: they insulate the vines from both the cold and the heat, and theyprovide ideal drainage for the roots. <BR><BR>Grapes sourced from La Crau, the lieu-dit that is known for the galet roulés, or rounded stones, that cover the vineyard for as far as the eye can see.

France;The Chardonnay grapes are hand-harvested and then quickly and gently pressed in a state-of-the-art pneumatic press, in order to extract all the fruit and aromas while avoiding any bitterness. After 2 days of cold stabilization and a light clearing of the juice (débourbage), Touzot slowly ferments his Mâcon Villages in temperature-controlled, stainless-steel cuves for 10 to 15 days. The wine is aged on its lees in tanks and undergoes full malolactic fermentation in January. It is then bottled in April. The wine is a text book example of Mâcon Villages : a lively bouquet of green apples and flowers (acacia is notable) and crisp, persistent, juicy green apple and melon Chardonnay fruit.<BR><BR>The three-generation Touzot family domaine is located in the northernmost part of the Mâcon region, just south of the Côte Chalonnaise. Their 11 hectares of vineyards overlooking the commune of Martaily les Brancion, near Tournus, are planted with 70% Chardonnay and 30% Pinot Noir and Gamay (for Bourgogne Rouge, Mâcon Rouge and Crémant). The Chardonnay vines are planted on several perfectly exposed slopes with ideal clay-limestone soils at an average altitude of 200 meters. In 2005, the Touzots added the 3 hectare Les Parettes Chardonnay vineyard which they prepared and planted themselves. It has an ideal, due-south exposure and a thin layer of stony, heat-retaining soil over a bed of pure limestone. The Chardonnay vines now average 30 years of age, making for a more concentrated and complex Mâcon Villages.<BR><BR>Jean’s son Frédéric took over management of the family domaine in 2002, after graduating from the Lycée Viticole in Mâcon and completing a stage in South Africa. He dedicated himself to moving the domaine’s viticultural practice to sustainability. He ended systematic vineyard treatments, and now only carries out treatments when absolutely necessary. He discontinued the use of herbicides and now regularly plows the soil to ensure its healthy state and encourage the vines’ roots to go deep into the limestone subsoil. Frédéric Touzot believes careful pruning in the winter, leaf stripping, and bunch thinning in abundant years which makes for a naturally healthy ambiance and enhances the quality of his wine. He uses organic fertilizers only when deemed necessary by tests of the soils. Touzot observes that his grapes are now both healthier and riper at harvest time. Environmentally friendly practices are also used inside the winery, such as the recycling and purification of rinse water before it is drained away. “I try to be more observant and attentive to the needs of vineyard,” explains Frédéric, “rather than habitually using the same practices every year. By respecting nature, I better understand my profession.” -Importer;Burgundy;White;12.99;13.0;2016 Domaine Jean Touzot Macon Villages ;Chardonnay;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/101728/bottle/754752/original.png;apple,   pear,   peach,   apricot,   lemon,   lime,   orange,   pineapple,   kiwi,   butter,   cream and   vanilla;0.75;apple,   pear,   peach,   apricot,   lemon,   lime,   orange,   pineapple,   kiwi,   butter,   cream and   vanilla

France;"Domaine Billaud-Simon in Chablis is comprised of about 42 acres, encompassing four Grands Crus vineyards, including one acre in Les Clos; one acre in Les Preuses; 1.75 acres in Vaudésir; and .44 acre in Les Blanchots. The Domaine also owns four Premiers Crus vineyards, including Montée de Tonnèrre, Mont-de-Milieu, Fourchaume and Vaillons. In addition to its crus wines, Domaine Billaud-Simon makes a Chablis Villages “Tête d’Or”, with grapes harvested exclusively from the estate. <BR><BR>In 1815, at the end of the Napoleonic wars, Charles Louis Noël Billaud returned home to Chablis and founded Domaine Billaud-Simon. There, thanks to his family’s holdings, he planted the first vines. Then, a little more than a century later in the 1930s, the Domaine’s vineyards were enlarged with the marriage of his descendant Jean Billaud to Renée Simon. <BR><BR>Located close to the Serein River, Jean Billaud’s son, Bernard, took over the estate until its acquisition by Domaine Faiveley in July 2014. Since then, Domaine Billaud-Simon is managed separately from Domaine Faiveley: It has its own vineyard, winemaking facilities and remains dedicated to uphold the same style of the wines while continually striving to improve their quality. Along with technical improvements in the modern winery, manual grape picking is increasingly being practiced for their Grands Crus and selected Premiers Crus. <BR><BR>The Chablis wines of Domaine Billaud-Simon exhibit elegance, balance and pure Chardonnay fruit.

Sergio Germano is just such a winemaker, and his Serralunga Barolos will never be creamy, international-style wines. Great wine is always made in the vineyard, and Sergio does much of the fieldwork himself, with the help of his wife Elena and a small crew.

His farming techniques go beyond sustainable. His changes in the cellar include, forinstance, the transition to concrete vats from stainless steel because concrete providesthe slower fermentation that he desires for the wines. He also replaced what he felt tobe aggressive pumps with a more gentle system, so that grape reception employs morefinesse with a better, more fine tuned selection process.

France; Today the current generation of Marie-Helene and Jean Pol run their own domaine consisting of vineyards passed down from generation to generation. They farm sustainably, growing their grapes in the 100% Grand Cru vineyards surrounding the village of Ay in the Grand Vallee de la Marne. Here the soils are comprised of chalk with belemite fossils or on calcerous and sedimentary soils in terroir very well suited for Pinot Noir (the wine is 75% Pinot Noir/25% Chardonnay). Very gentle pressing is employed so the wines are perfectly detailed and expressive, using 1.5 kg of grapes per bottle rather than the allowed 1.2 which would require harsher pressing to get the same amount of juice. Wines are aged, 20% of reserve in neutral barrels, dosage is all natural, and it is sur lee for about 15-18 months. The result is a beautiful bubbly, with lovely hints of brioche, yellow fruits, cool, stony and mineral with a fine mousse. Perfect all on its own or with a wide range of appetizers, especially seafood, shrimp, stone crab, smoked salmon blinis with creme fraiche and caviar. ;Champagne;White;44.99;13.0;2009 Domaine Andre Roger Brut Champagne Millesime;blend;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/102315/bottle/752491/original.png;barnyard,   cherry,   plum,   game,   tomato,   apple,   pear,   peach,   apricot,   lemon,   lime,   orange,   pineapple,   kiwi,   butter,   cream and   vanilla;0.75;ripe cherry,   plum,   strawberry,   raspberry,   mushroom,   apple,   pear,   peach,   apricot,   lemon,   lime,   orange,   pineapple,   kiwi,   butter,   cream and   vanilla
France;The base wine of this Vieilles Vignes Brut Rosé Champagne comes from plots whose vines are, on average, 45 years old. Each Pinot Noir vinestock from these vines yields a third less fruit than a younger vine, thus giving a more distinctive aromatic potential and optimal maturity at harvesting.This Rosé champagne is made from a blend of white and red wine, mainly Pinot Noir from Ay. It has a delicate colour evocative of old rose petals. Its very white foam gives a sensation of freshness and this delicacy is expressed in its bouquet of wild strawberries mingled with cherry. Notes of ripe lemon, freshly-cut hay and a touch of lime flower are also perceptible. In the mouth it is gentle yet eager.

Austria;Icewine (Eiswein) has to be clearly distinguished from other noble sweet wine products regarding the production method. With 25 % sugar content in the pressed must it is equal to Beerenauslese (BA) but whilst all noble sweet wines contain more or less Botrytis and are produced from shrivelled grapes, the Icewine is made from harvesting “healthy” grapes but in a frozen state. By pressing frozen grapes immediately, the frozen water is separated from the juice (must) as Ice crystals, so the high sugar concentration can be reached. (Would the same grapes not be frozen, the separated Ice would be within the must as water and the concentration would be less.) The fine balance between sweetness and acidity is the basis of the typical character of an Icewine. An essential element of a classic Icewine is a certain racy, fiery trait based on a sufficient structure of acidity. The notable difference between Icewine and traditional dessert wines is, that Icewine, produced by an expert, presents a fine fruitness from the bouquet to the end of the tasting because of the total or partial absence of noble rot (Botrytis). The typical characteristics of the grape variety should be noticeable;Burgenland;White;33.99;8.5;2010 Hafner Muskat Ottonel Ice Wine;Muscat;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/102466/bottle/752490/original.png;grapey,   coriander,   peach and   orange;0.375;pineapple,   coriander,   peach,   orange and   grapey

United States;2014 was a warm and very dry year. Fortunately these grapes love heat and the struggle of the drought has produced beautifully dense fruit flavors. Wild Thing Zinfandel went through fermentation uninoculated, relying on a healthy WILD yeast population from the organic vineyard to create a terroir-driven complexity of aroma and flavors. Our wild fermentation started after a four day cold soak and was followed by a 23 day maceration. The must was déléstaged (pronounced 'del-ess-TAHJd) two times prior to the wine reaching 10°Brix. That is the fancy, French term for a rack and return—a process that aerates the wine, helps to maintain a healthy yeast population, and builds mouthfeel volume with gentle extraction from the skins. ;California;Red;15.19;14.5;2014 Carol Shelton Wild Thing Zinfandel;Zinfandel;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/102561/bottle/752614/original.png;candy,   vanilla,   oak,   smoke,   tar,   musk and   mushroom;0.75;jam,   blueberry,   black pepper,   cherry,   plum,   boysenberry,   cranberry and   licorice

France;"When Cédric Lecareux and his wife Catherine, native of Beaujolais, discovered the property, it was love at first sight. Located in Regnie-Durette, the wine estate, steeped in history for more than 250 years, charmed them with its old stones and ancient arched cellars. With an existing winery and 3.5 hectares of old Gamay vines surrounding the house, everything was there for them to combine their wine project and family life. They took the plunge and made their first vintage in 2014. Two years later, they bought an additional 2 ha of vines. A trained agronomist and oenologist, Cedric spent nearly 15 years working in the wine business before achieving his dream. Everything he does is hands on and natural; the results are purely-fruited, fresh Beaujolais that remarkably express all the richness of their exceptional terroir. Total production is around 30,000 bottles.The word “Capréoles” comes from the Old French and means vine tendrils.

On the palate the wine is fullish, tangy and still young, with fine intensity of flavor, moderate tannins, good acids and a long, tangy and youthful finish. This is a touch leaner in 2016 than in past vintages, which I assume is a reflection of some hail impact in one or both of the parcels (one of these lies on the Morgon- Re´gnie´ border and most certainly was hit), but the wine is quite clean and just a touch less plush at the core than is customary. Give it a couple of years to blossom. 2019-2040.;Beaujolais;Red;26.99;13.0;2016 Julien Sunier Morgon;Gamay;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/102598/bottle/752689/original.png;violet,   rose petal,   oak,   smoke and   mushroom;0.75;cherry,   strawberry and   raspberry
France;The 2016 Regnie was matured in six-year-old barrels. It felt a little more disjointed at the nose compared to its Morgon counterpart, although with aeration it melds together with scents of black plum, a hint of brine and a slight loamy scent that comes through with time. The palate is well balanced with fine grip on the entry. There is good backbone to this Regnie, more saline than Antoine Sunier's Morgon with a lively, focused finish. Excellent.;Beaujolais;Red;19.99;13.5;2016 Antoine Sunier Regnie;Gamay;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/102599/bottle/752656/original.png;violet,   rose petal,   oak,   smoke and   mushroom;0.75;cherry,   strawberry and   raspberry
France;The 2016 Morgon, which comes from 60-year-old vines in Croix de Chevre and is matured in eight-year-old barrels for eight months, has a clean and precise bouquet with lifted blackberry, raspberry and just a hint of pressed flowers. This is very refined, and I appreciate the manner in which it opens in the glass. The palate is well balanced with crisp acidity, quite mineral-driven and tensile with a dash of white pepper enlivening the sappy, chalky-textured finish.

France;Gevrey AC from Domaine Trapet is extremely lovely for a village wine. The purity and transparency of the vintage are very much in evidence in this fine bottle, as the wine delivers a bouquet of black cherries, plums, dark soil tones, gamebirds, cocoa and a smoky topnote.

Spain;Tempranillo Blanco? Who knew? It certainly was a first for us. It was only discovered in 1988 as a mutation of the regal Tempranillo red grape from Rioja. This is unique, but not unheard of. Grapes likeGrenache Blanc, Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay (once called Pinot Chardonnay) are all a direct kin of their red counterparts.Bodegas Fernandez de Pierola, founded in 1996, is a relative newcomer in the Rioja where grapes have been planted for over 2,000 years. It is a moderate- sized family-run operation in the centerof Rioja known as the Rioja Alavesa region. It began with the family vineyards in Moreda where there is an expansive history of wine. Slowly but surely, this winery has grown leaps and bounds.Unlike the whites made here just a few decades ago, these new whites of Spain are clean and fresh, utilizing cold fermentation and very careful handling to preserve the flavors of the grape.Our selection is barrel fermented so there is that hint of vanilla, which blends perfectly with the tropical fruit scents.

France;"Chateau Lamartine was built in 1922 on the site of a century old oak tree. Local legend recounts that in the Middle Ages this was where Martine, the daughter of the local Baron, would meet her various suitors. This family property dates back to the Middle Ages, and the vineyards have survived the Gallo-Roman wars as well the invasion of phylloxera in 1878.Born in the Chateau, the current winemaker/owner, Alain Gayraud, took over from his grandparents in 1975. Encompassing 28 hectares of vines ranging in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahors appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the Atlantic influence. The vineyards here dominate the best micro-climate along the Lot River, and all of the plots are south facing on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil is a limestone base with lots of stones.The grape of Cahors is known by several names. The ancient name of Auxerrois is rarely ever used. Instead the locals call this dark, inky berry Cot. In other parts of the world it is known as Malbec. Alain maintains sustainable agricultural practices and does a minimum of 2,000 hours worth of green harvesting per vintage in order to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The depth of the roots mean that the vines are very rarely over stressed, even in the hottest of years. The total production is always around 10,000 cases a year."" - Importer ";Southwest;Red;13.98;12.5;2014 Chateau Lamartine Cahors ;Malbec;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/102837/bottle/752559/original.png;spice,   earth,   currant and   cherry;0.75;pepper,   earth,   green,   plum,   mocha and   currant
Spain;"    J. Antonio Ponce offers us a delightful little Monastrell wine with his Depaula. If you've ever come across vegetal notes in wines made from this grape and they've not really been to your taste, have no fear; it has some of those notes but they're very pleasant, and not at all bitter; they give the wine character, conferring vivacity and personality.    Depaula is fresh and mineral, with profound aromas, ripe red fruit, toasty notes, caramel and sweetish touches, as well as hints of gunpowder. Once poured into the glass it's lusciously sweet on the nose, and reveals the Monastrell's energetic character on swirling it around. On the palate it gives the feeling of a complete wine, with chewy fruit, and it has that rustic element typical of the variety, yet still very polished. Remarkably complex for a wine at this price, a rounded wine that leaves a most pleasant sensation at the end, a merit justly attributed to its producer of course.    Don't be misled by its price, as you can decant it!

Having grown up in Burgundy’s famous Côte d’Or, he was always attracted to viticulture, but his family’s vines were all rented out to métayeurs (share croppers), and they did not make their own wine. Instead, he gravitated towards Geology, a field that gave him an expertise in soil. His wife, Christine, comes from the famous Latour family, and her father, André Masson (once the régisseur at the Hospices de Beaune), had his own vines. In 1990, when the opportunity came to join André’s domaine in Aloxe-Corton, Franck jumped at the chance, giving up one noble career in terroir to take on another. In 1993, André retired and Franck took over the direction of the domaine.<BR><BR>Franck and Christine are fortunate to farm one village wine, four premier crus, and four grand crus in Aloxe-Corton (their hometown), Pernand-Vergelesses, and Vosne-Romanée. Pedigreed land such as this demands much of its stewards, so Franck farms sustainably without synthetic fertlizers or weed killers, working the soils regularly to aerate them and keep them healthy. Their winery and cellars are as picturesque as they are practical—said to be the deepest in their village. In traditional Burgundian homes of this time (1764), the family lives on the second and third floors, above a first floor winery and deep cellars below. This kind of depth makes the cellars colder and more humid than most, two key components in crafting age-worthy wines. Vinifications are in the old-school style, fermenting slowly in open-top wooden vats, using only indigenous yeasts, and the wines are bottled in all of their unadultered glory, unfined and unfiltered. Both pure and intense, they are deep with stony freshness, explosive with bright fruit, and framed with balanced structure."" -Importer";Burgundy;White;49.99;13.0;2014 Follin Arbelet Pernand Vergeless Blanc;Chardonnay;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/102928/bottle/752571/original.png;apple,   pear,   peach,   apricot,   lemon,   lime,   orange,   pineapple,   kiwi,   butter,   cream and   vanilla;0.75;apple,   pear,   peach,   apricot,   lemon,   lime,   orange,   pineapple,   kiwi,   butter,   cream and   vanilla

United States;Keenan Winery is located in Spring Mountain District, high in the Mayacamas mountain range above the town of Saint Helena. Eleven acres of Merlot vines have been planted in the rocky soils surrounding the winery, and it is these vines that produce some of the finest Merlot in Napa. The vineyards are situated above the dense layer of fog that creeps up the Napa Valley most evenings. Consequently the vines warm up earlier in the morning and stay warm through the night. The combination of warm temperatures, steep hillside vine rows and gravelly soils promotes more stress on the vines leading to increased intensity in the finished wine.The 2014 Keenan Merlot is composed of eighty one percent Keenan Estate Merlot. Nineteen percent of the wine is Merlot fruit harvested from the Napa Carneros region. After hand harvesting, the grapes were de-stemmed, then inoculated with Montrachet yeast. Fermentation ranged from ten to fourteen days.The ‘14 Merlot has been aged in thirty-three percent new French and American oak barrels for eighteen months.

Malbec contributed deep plum notes, while Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot completed the blend with nuances of rose, forest loam and graphite.We tailored the winemaking for each varietal to best capture the personality of both the vintage and specific vineyard block. Cold soaking of the destemmed grapes, gentle punch-downs in open-top fermentors and in-barrel malolactic fermentation all contributed to this wine’s richly textured flavors.

As all things lead back to the land for the brothers, the name Bagordi is no different.

The wine is aged for twelve months in American oak barrels followed by at least one year of bottle age. The wine pours a deep red with violet highlights.

France;"Also from parcels heavily infused with granite, the Fleurie « Grand Pré” is the classic, workhorse wine of this estate. From vines with an average age of forty (40) years, this Fleurie undergoes a cuvaison between 10 and 15 days, the length of which depends on the underlying structure of the grapes from each specific vintage.

This energetic couple follows the precepts of “lutte raisonnée” when working the vineyards, which is to say they use an organic approach, treating the vines only when absolutely necessary to produce a healthy, ripe crop.At Domaine de la Chapelle des Bois, the wines are vinified in a traditional manner using a “semi-carbonic” maceration. The cuvaison extends for 10 to 15 days depending on the specific cuvée. A grill placed on top of the cuve and then partially submerged is often utilized during the fermentation period to keep the solid matter in continuous contact with the fermenting juice; this process of extraction is supplemented by a twice-a-day “remontage” or pumping of the juice over the solids during the cuvaison.";Beaujolais;Red;19.98;12.0;2015 Domaine De La Chapelle Des Bois Grand Pre Fleurie;Gamay;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/103374/bottle/753329/original.png;violet,   rose petal,   oak,   smoke and   mushroom;0.75;cherry,   strawberry and   raspberry

France;From a small 0.65ha site found just 100 meters from the Clos des Rocs Monopole, this parcel yields a surprisingly different wine. A poor top layer of soil means the vines suffer more than neighboring plots, resulting in small, concentrated grapes. The ancient 90 year-old vines also contribute to the low yields. Elevage is all in demi-muid (500L barrels), and the wine shows the rich concentration with generous fruit on the palate, yet the freshness and focus are unwavering. We note a lovely hint of beeswax to the nose and touch of bitterness to the finish – a remarkable wine of depth and character that testifies to the worthiness of this rarely seen appellation.;Burgundy;White;29.99;13.5;2013 Domaine Du Clos Des Rocs Pouilly Loche Monpole;Chardonnay;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/103376/bottle/753350/original.png;apple,   pear,   peach,   apricot,   lemon,   lime,   orange,   pineapple,   kiwi,   butter,   cream and   vanilla;0.75;apple,   pear,   peach,   apricot,   lemon,   lime,   orange,   pineapple,   kiwi,   butter,   cream and   vanilla

France;"The 2012 Chablis 1er Cru Sechets has a very stony and granitic, almost terracotta-infused bouquet that is well-defined and very earthy. The palate is nicely balanced with good concentration, demonstrating a little more depth than the Vaillons, with a primal grapefruit and lime-tinged finish that is very linear and strict. This would just be my pick over the Vaillons. Drink now-2017. While I am familiar with the wines of Vincent Dauvissat, I must confess that I was less familiar when it comes to Jean & Sebastien Dauvissat. Perhaps that is because they have less exposure here in the UK, but given the quality, I hope that changes because these wines were quite a revelation. No, they did not quite reach the heady heights over at Vincent Dauvissat. But my word – this was a damn impressive portfolio that I look forward to revisiting. Sebastien Dauvissat, the son of Jean who passed away several years ago, was there to greet me at the winery almost next door to Francois Raveneau. There are around 10 hectares of vine and the fermentation and elevage are conducted in stainless steel vats. I asked Sebastien how he perceives the 2013 vintage and whether there are any other vintages it is comparable to. He answered that the 2013s reminded him of the 2002 vintage due to its floral aromas. The yield was around 32 hectoliters per hectare and the 2013s were harvested in six days, 10 days earlier than the 2012s, with only the young vines suffering. Due to the extended time in barrel, these wines are released later than others, so I tasted a mixture of both young and older Chablis, which were as impressive as each other. The leitmotif was precision – a virtue that I always seek in Chablis – and that word kept cropping up in my notes.

France;VINIFICATION AND AGEINGHarvesting is entirely by hand. The grapes are transported in small crates then carefully sorted on arrival at the vat-house. Thereafter, they are totally destemmed and gravity-fed to vat, to maintain their integrity. After a pre-fermentation maceration for 5 to 6 days at 10°C, alcoholic fermentation starts off naturally at regulated temperature. During this period, daily tasting allows the operations of punching down and pumping over to be adjusted to the specificities of the vintage. After two to three weeks in vat the wines are housed in oak barrels (of which 25% new oak) for a period of 12 to 14 months. In barrel, malolactic fermentation occurs naturally in spring. After racking, wines are assembled in vat, until bottling by us during the following winter, without fining or filtering.TASTE PROFILEThis Pinot Noir develops a deep and intense bouquet. The first taste impression is generous, fine and fruity. This wine could almost seem ‘gourmand’ and for early-drinking if the ripe tannins and the structure on the finish did not come to remind us we are dealing with a wine for keeping. Three to five years in bottle would be beneficial to it…GASTRONOMIC HARMONYThis wine will go very well with game and with stews, even if these are highly seasoned. It will also support the presence of mature cheeses of strong character, such as Epoisses, Brillat-Savarin, Livarot…;Burgundy;Red;42.98;13.0;2013 Rollin Aloxe Corton;Pinot Noir;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/103380/bottle/753331/original.png;barnyard,   cherry,   plum,   game and   tomato;0.75;ripe cherry,   plum,   strawberry,   raspberry and   mushroom
France;"The Vaucrains lieu-dit is recognized as one of the finest of the entire range of 1er Crus in this appellation. The Chezeaux domaine owns a bit more than a quarter-hectare in this elite site which is composed of a formidable mix of heavy clay and limestone. The vines rest on a 15 degree-angled site with an east-northeast exposure. We expect exceptional results from this vineyard as the vines, about twenty years of age as of this writing (2012), continue to mature.<BR><BR> We were introduced to Jérome Chézeaux in the mid-1990s by Régis Forey, whose father, Jean, was amongst our very first suppliers of wine from the Cote de Nuits back in 1980. We had been looking to supplement the wines that Régis was providing to us from his various holdings in Vosne Romanée and Nuits Saint Georges. He was generous enough to refer us to this small gem of domaine which, to our surprise, encompassed holdings in some of the most prestigious vineyard sites in this southern tier of the Cote de Nuits. We started with the 1994 vintage and haven’t missed a beat since.<BR><BR>The Chezeaux domaine was built on the foundations of an estate owned since 1930 by Julien Missery. Bernard Chezeaux acceded to the ownership of the domaine in 1971 selling most of the wines produced there to negociants during his reign. On his untimely death in 1993, his son, Jérome, took over the direction of the domaine and it was at this moment that we made Jérome’s acquaintance. It was a fortuitous encounter as our collaboration has meshed perfectly with Jérome’s intention to increase the amount of wine bottled at the estate.<BR><BR>The estate, which is based in Prémeaux-Prissey just south of Nuits Saint Georges, owns approximately 12 hectares of vineyards, some of which were brought into play from the family holdings of Jérome’s wife, Pierrette. The vineyards, impeccably tended according to the principles of “lutte raisonnée”, are scattered throughout the villages of Prémeaux, Nuits Saint Georges, Vougeot and Vosne Romanée and include, as mentioned above, a series of the most elite lieu-dits in the zone.Jérome Chézeaux strictly follows the most traditional of methods in the cellar being firmly “non-interventionist”. The purity of his wines is revelatory; there is an understated majesty to every offering in the portfolio. After a manual harvest, the grapes undergo a cold maceration of 3 to 4 days and the entire cuvaison extends for approximately three weeks. During that time remontage and pigeage are practiced; the extent to which both techniques are used depends on the structure of the vintage. Indigenous yeasts are used exclusively and malolactic fermentation occurs in small oak barrels during the extended elevage. Each year between a quarter and one-third of the barrels are replaced which means that the wines are exposed at most to 30% new oak. The wines are bottled without filtration between 18 to 24 months after harvest."" -Importer";Burgundy;Red;69.99;13.0;2014 Jerome Chezeaux Nuits St. Georges Les Vaucrans 1er Cru;Pinot Noir;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/103381/bottle/753355/original.png;barnyard,   cherry,   plum,   game and   tomato;0.75;ripe cherry,   plum,   strawberry,   raspberry and   mushroom

France;Chateau Beausejour Montagne St. Emilion has a long history in the Bordeaux wine region. The property was first established in 1851, by the Laporte family. At the time, the Laporte’s owned other estates in the Bordeaux region as well. The chateau was known for producing one of the best wines in the Montagne, St. Emilion region, also known as the St. Emilion Satellite Appellations. Things took a big step forward for Chateau Beausejour Montagne in 2004 when Patricia and Pierre Bernault bought Chateau Beausejour.

Italy;The grapes were picked in different periods and fermented separately, variety by variety.After the destemming and a soft pressing, the must fermented on the skins of the grapes for approximately a week in stainless steel tanks. During this phase, the must finished its fermentation at  temperatures held to a maximum of 77° Fahrenheit (25° centigrade) and was then racked before going through the malolactic fermentation, which finished by the end of winter.The bottling of the 2016 Santa Cristina Rosso began in October of 2017.The first vintage of Santa Cristina was produced by Marquis Niccolò Antinori, father of Piero Antinori, in 1946. Over time Santa Cristina has become a reference point for connoisseurs, and not merely these consumers, thanks a constant commitment to high quality. The care and attention always given to both the vineyard work and the work in the cellar have been the stimulus for constant innovation and for measuring professional work and capacities with both native and international grape varieties. The result has been a family of wines, all different from one another, but distinguished by the same style, fruit of the indissoluble link between the vineyard, the terroir, and human contributions and input. Classic Santa Cristina has thus been joined by Santa Cristina Bianco, Santa Cristina Rosato, and Santa Cristina Le Mastrelle along with Campo Grande and Cipresseto. Together with the Santa Cristina extra-virgin olive oil, Donato, and the Santa Cristina Grappa, they represent a new step forward for a long and well established viticultural tradition.;Tuscany;Red;10.55;12.5;2015 Antinori Santa Cristina;blend;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/103665/bottle/753641/original.png;violet,   rose,   truffle,   earth,   coffee,   leather,   spice box,   cedar,   dark fruit,   asparagus,   green pepper,   red fruit,   currant,   blackberry,   cherry and   cigar box;0.75;currant,   black cherry,   plum,   bell pepper,   olive,   oak,   smoke,   toast,   tar,   blueberry,   blackberry,   strawberry,   red fruit,   raspberry,   cherry,   asparagus,   spice,   ginger and   vanilla

In addition to completely eliminating the use of herbicides, he propagates regional plants and herbs, prepares his own compost and spreads local straw, marc and raw fertilizer throughout his vineyards. As is the goal of most mindful growers, Max lets the grapes hang as long as possible to ensure they reach—and in some cases exceed—physiological ripeness, or as Max refers to it, “mineral ripeness”; the Saar is the coolest and most windy region in Germany and often requires a longer hang-time than in warmer regions of the world."" -Importer";Ruwer;White;29.99;8.0;2015 Von Hovel Riesling Spatlese Hutte Oberemmel Monopole;Riesling;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/103667/bottle/753512/original.png;petrol,   flint,   rose petal,   violet,   orange peel,   apple,   pear and   peach;0.75;apple,   pear,   peach,   apricot and   honey

Opulent but structured, this versatile wine has supple blue and black fruit notes accented by dark chocolate, roasted coffee and a silky, lingering finish.Beringer Vineyards has owned and farmed its Knights Valley vineyards since the mid-1960’s, when the Beringer family recognized that the cobbled alluvial soils were a great place to grow high quality wine grapes. The Knights Valley designation was first used on a Beringer label in 1974. Beringer was instrumental in garnering official recognition for the area in 1983 as a premier wine growing region in the form of its own American Viticulture Area (AVA) designation.Vineyard NotesLocated 17 miles northwest of the winery, Knights Valley vineyard is approximately 600 acres, and has rocky, well-drained soils that are perfectly suited to Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot.Vintage NotesEarly, a bit challenged by the cumulative impact of the drought years, but exceptional in quality for the smaller amount of fruit that was harvested. That’s the story of the 2015 growing season. A mild winter caused early bud break, followed by protracted bloom and unseasonably cool weather in spring, contributing to smaller grape clusters and variable crop size.WINEMAKINGTo maintain the unique characteristics of the different lots from varying areas of the vineyard, each is monitored carefully through the vinification process. Extended maceration created larger tannins to enhance the lush mouthfeel of the blend and extracted a maximum of color, aromas and flavors. The wines were then aged in French oak barrels (25 percent new) for 16 months and underwent malolactic fermentation for further development of texture and mouthfeel.;California;Red;19.68;14.3;2015 Beringer Cabernet Sauvignon Knight;blend;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/103692/bottle/753685/original.png;currant,   blackberry,   cherry,   cedar,   cigar box,   violet,   rose,   truffle,   earth,   coffee,   leather,   tobacco,   broccoli,   berry,   flower,   mocha and   vanilla;0.75;currant,   blackberry,   cherry,   bell pepper,   olive,   asparagus,   spice,   ginger,   oak,   vanilla,   black cherry,   plum,   smoke,   toast,   tar,   tobacco,   raspberry,   cassis,   violet,   pepper,   green bean,   lead,   cedar,   molasses and   dark fruit

United States;"In the earliest years of Alban Vineyards, I lived in a rented green house propagating cuttings.  When I wasn’t making vines, I was busy looking for the future home for all the vines in my nursery.  I spent 7 years looking at possible vineyard sites all over the Central Coast of California.  Whenever I found a promising site, I negotiated a due diligence period during which I could do soil and site analysis.  While mapping out the last piece I’d ever evaluate (because it was the one that turned into Alban Vineyards) I happened to name a little ridge on one part of the ranch ‘Reva’s Ridge’.  It was a play on words incorporating the name of a Kentucky Derby winner: Riva’s Ridge, and my mother’s name which is Reva.  Clearly I’d been in the sun too long and I will admit that I am a total ‘mama’s boy’.  Years later, after calling the vineyard Reva and tagging the first barrel as Reva, I embraced the obvious: I named the wine Reva.  <BR><BR>The grapes that go into Reva (97-100% Syrah with the balance Viognier) are from neutral sandy soils and portions of ranch that are chalky and quite alkaline.  This combination makes for a wine with dark color, concentrated flavors of black fruits, fennel, and graphite.  Perhaps the most distinguishing note of Reva is a unique iodine and oyster shell aromatic that is unlike anything in our other Syrahs.   The wine is aged 3.5 years in barrels before bottling unfined and unfiltered.""  -Winery";California;Red;94.99;14.0;2013 Alban Vineyards Reva Syrah;Syrah / Shiraz;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/103702/bottle/753647/original.png;spice box,   cedar and   dark fruit;0.75;currant,   blueberry,   blackberry and   strawberry

Spain;The entry-level red of the venture with Eric Solomon of U.S. importer European Cellars is the unoaked 2016 Evodia. Apparently Evodia means 'fragrant' in Greek, and this wine wants to be a good representation of the Garnachas growing up in Aragon over many years, with their own clones and flavors. It fermented in concrete vats where it matured for six months. I tasted from two bottles, one just opened and the other one that had been open for 24 hours. They showed slightly differently, the recent a little oakier and the 24-hour one a little sweeter. This is a juicy, fresh Garnacha within the powerful style of the zone, in a cooler year. It's very tasty, with the spicy touch of real barrels with ripe fruit at the foreground. The fact that the bottle that was opened for one day showed much better the ability of the wine to keep it - and improve! - in bottle. It would work wonders at barbecues!

In 1978, visionary vineyard developer William Hill saw the incredible potential of the Silverado Bench, where he built his namesake winery. More than three decades later, our winemaker Ralf Holdenried is making modern wines that speak to the unique terroir of this virtually unknown area of southern Napa Valley. A confluence of characteristics makes our 140-acre estate an ideal vineyard. Set on a benchland – off the valley floor, but below the steeper slopes of the hills – with a southwestern exposure, the vines bask in abundant sunlight. The vineyard is close to the valley floor climatically, but the volcanic soil and the size and vigor of the vines means William Hill is more like a mountaintop vineyard.

Rounded and silky on the palate, flavors of ripe melon and citrus oil are underscored by juicy fruit and mouthwatering acidity. Subtle toasted oak notes and a hint of anise spice add warmth and richness to the long, focused finish.The 2016 growing season started out with a mild January followed by a warm and dry February. Budbreak was early but the arrival of much-needed rains in March slowed things down. Spring brought moderate weather with very little frost but spots of rain during bloom made yields variable. Variability continued to be a factor through summer with big swings in temperature. In August, mild days were followed by cool nights and foggy mornings—perfect for slow ripening our Chardonnay.

France;"100% Syrah. This cuvée comes from various vineyard parcels across the Courbis domaine, mostly from vines near the base of Cornas slope. They are blended to produce a wine ready for near term drinking upon release. The soils are a combination of only limestone and granite. The Cornas Champelrose benefits from 3 weeks of vatting to extract as much color and flavor as possible. It is aged entirely in casks that are a mix of 25% new; 20% one year; and 55% 2-3 years of age. The barrel-aging period is 12 months, after which the wine is assembled in tank and aged for four more months before bottling. The wine has generous, accessible, pure fruit and shows the full character of its appellation in the attractive Courbis house style.The origins of the Courbis family estate date back to the 16th century. More recently, the brothers Dominique and Laurent Courbis succeeded their father, Maurice, in the early 1990s. They have since firmly established themselves as leaders of the modern school of winemaking in St Joseph and Cornas. The Courbis style may be summarized as offering wines filled with intense aromas and concentrated fruit with great purity and length. This is in large part achieved by a combination of meticulous and sustainable vineyard work undertaken to attain perfectly ripe, healthy, concentrated grapes together with fermenting in tanks and aging in barriques. The wines emphasize the expression of fruit while highlighting the specific character of the various St-Joseph and Cornas vineyard origins.The estate owns 33 hectares divided as follows: 8 hectares in Cornas; 5 hectares of St Joseph Blanc; 19 hectares of St Joseph Rouge and 1 hectare of Syrah Vin de Pays de l’Ardèche. The vineyards are all on south and east facing slopes in the communes of Châteaubourg, Glun and Cornas. All the grapes are harvested by hand, rigorously sorted and 100% de-stemmed. The maceration period for the Syrahs lasts between two and four weeks. The wines mature in barriques which are new or up to three years old. They are bottled between 18 months and two years after harvest.The Courbis brothers produce some of the most compelling examples of St. Joseph and Cornas being made today. They have successfully combined their long family experience with a modern style, and their achievement has earned them international recognition.

United States;VINTAGEThe 2014 vintage was another eventful year in Napa Valley with the August earthquake and the third consecutive year with below normal rainfall. The vines were awaking two weeks earlier than normal, but managed to produce healthy canopies with bountiful yields. The lack of late season rain took the pressure off of the vintners allowing the grapes to hang until optimum aroma and flavor profiles were achieved.VINIFICATIONGrapes were sorted in the field and winery, and then fermented in small, jacketed stainless steel tanks. Barrel aging occurred in 70% new French Oak for 23 months before the wine was then bottled without fining or filtration. -- Winery;California;Red;229.99;14.5;2014 Brand Napa Cabernet Sauvignon;Cabernet Sauvignon;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/104009/bottle/755676/original.png;currant,   blackberry,   cherry,   cedar and   cigar box;0.75;currant,   blackberry,   cherry,   bell pepper,   olive,   asparagus,   spice,   ginger,   oak and   vanilla

France;"Located in southern Burgundy, 20 km North of Mâcon, Domaine Pascal Bonhomme began in 2001, with 2.5 hectares of vines in appellation Viré Clessé (the commune so-named since 1998) and today encompasses some 6 hectares. The terroir here is argilo-calcareous. Green harvest is made according to the nature of each vintage. Grass is allowed to grow freely between the vines. The grape harvest remains manual, and the pressing of the grapes is done by pneumatic press. The wine making remains traditional, temperature controlled alcoholic fermentation, 100% malolactic fermentation most years. Aging on the fine lees, then a light filtration before bottling.

The cold spring made a difficult flowering period, and also berry set. The grapes were also affected by the rains, ripening at a much slower pace than previous vintages.

The soil is sandy calcareous of alluvial origins. Fermentation is performed at controlled temperatures in stainless steel tanks. The final blend is inoculated with selected yeast before undergoing a second fermentation in autoclave stainless steel tanks. Once fermentation is completed, the internal pressure within the tanks is approximately 13lbs/0.5inch2 (6kgs/cm2).

United States;Led by a trio with roots that stretch from California to Tennessee and through several generations, BNA Wine Group is creating what consumers want today - great wine for a better price. Headquartered in Nashville, Tenn. and adopting our name from the city’s BNA airport moniker, our company has hands-on experience and a keen understanding of both sides of the wine business, and the capital and passion to help our wines take flight. Fourth-generation wine and spirits distributor John Hooper sold the business his family founded in 1939, and teamed with Little Lion Wine Company founder and winemaker Tony Leonardini and industry sales veteran Gary Carr to launch BNA Wine Group. We bring a fresh approach to the wine industry through an arm’s length perspective. This comes from being headquartered in Tennessee, while maintaining an office and a physical presence in St. Helena, Calif., where we do business and have good relationships with various vineyards and wineries. Tony has built a solid reputation as a winemaker and works with various vineyards to source grapes and then craft our wines. Like John, Tony also grew up in and worked his way through the industry. His first job was breaking down boxes for a nickel a piece in his family’s San Francisco wine shop. At his family’s winery just north of Oakville, Calif., Tony worked and learned the process from the crush to the bottling line. He made his first bottle of wine in 2000, and his first commercial wine in 2005 -- one barrel of Cabernet made with grapes sourced from his backyard. A year later, Tony produced the noteworthy Volunteer Napa Cabernet Sauvignon, named for his other role as a St. Helena volunteer firefighter. We take pride in creating distinctive wines notable for taste and value.

United States;"The 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon -  the first Cabernet produced by Andy Erickson and his  team - marks the beginning of a bright new era of winemaking at Mayacamas.  Since taking over   stewardship of the estate in 2013, our efforts have been focused on the unique challenge of     maintaining the traditional methods while simultaneously improving quality.  Through meticulous    restoration of the winery and a renewed focus on the details of great farming and winemaking,    we feel the 2013 Cabernet represents the first step in an exciting journey forward at Mayacamas. VINTAGE, VINEYARDS & TERROIRThe 2013 growing season and harvest were ideal at Mayacamas. Warm spring temperatures and dry weather resulted early bud break, consistent flowering and even fruit set. Warm summer days and cool foggy nights provided the perfect balance for ripeness.  A heat spike in early September signaled the start of the Cabernet harvest on September 10 – our last fruit arrived at the winery October 8th.  Grapes for the 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon were harvested exclusively from high-ele-vation vineyards, some more than 40+ years old.  Mount Veeder is a one-of-a-kind appellation with a cooler mountain climate and the lowest yields in Napa Valley.  Soils range from poor volcanic deposits to ancient seabed; the grapes produced here retain high acidity and a clean, mineral character.Our grapes are harvested early to retain bright acidity and firm tannins.  For fermentation we utilize a combination of cement vat fermenters, open-top foudre and stainless steel.  After approximately two weeks on skins, we gently press and are ready for aging. The 2013 Cabernet aged 32 months in neutral oak – 20 months in large format foudre and 12 months in barrique.  After bottling, the wine was cellared for 12 additional months before release. Savory, bright and deep, this generous wine offers black cherry, ripe blackberry, and mission fig. On the palate herb notes of star anise, marjoram and French lavender provide complexity and depth alongside the juicy bramble fruits. Secondary notes of graphite, cacao and pencil lead hint at classic wines of the old world.

United States;"This Three Vineyard Pinot Noir has stuck a fantastic balance between the warm ripening season of 2013 and the coller picking season right before harvest, giving us the best of both worlds in one wine. There is a beautiful ripe black cherry and brambly cassis on the nose, with fresh wet earth and a tea leaf component. White pepper, dusty cocoa, tobacco, sweet loam, and raspberry accentuate the nose, providing a fresh, full complex package. The palate is lithe and playful, with especially round, pilable acid, and an overarching flavor of rich cranberry sauce and rose hips.

United States;Our Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon delivers the highest quality from our premier Napa Valley vineyards. After destemming, the grapes were transferred to upright tanks for a two- to three-day cold soak. The must was pumped over up to three times a day, with some delestage for the Petite Sirah and Petit Verdot lots to soften tannins. We tasted each lot daily to determine the optimal drainage time, which ultimately led to some extended maceration for the Cabernet.

France;The Cuvée Classique blend combines grapes from the estate’s different terroirs. In the area known as ‘Le Petit Moulin de la Cadière’, named after its windmill, the vines grow on south-facing terraces stretching out over hilly terrain. The soil in this part of the vineyard is characterised by the presence of fossilised seashells (85 million year old bivalve molluscs). Clay is found to varying depths throughout the estate’s soil and, although the clay is quite dense, alluvial layers comprised of silt-sand sediment deposits are also present. One might think these looser layers in the soil would have little influence on the wine, but in fact they provide excellent drainage which helps to produce very refined wines.;Provence;Red;39.99;14.0;2015 Domaine Tempier Bandol Rouge;blend;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/104622/bottle/757299/original.png;"thyme

France;The La Migoua vineyard is on the outskirts of the village of Le Beausset, perched on the southern face of the Le Beausset-Vieux hill range on a chalk and clay terroir. Strata of 200 million year old Muschelkalk can be found here. The soil structure varies throughout the vineyard from stony to various colours of clay ranging from red to ochre to almost blue in some places. The terroir is in the form of a natural amphitheatre with an average altitude of 270m above sea level. Cuvée La Migoua is comprised of 50 to 65 % Mourvedre depending on the year. A significant amount of Cinsault is also grown in this vineyard, particularly on the south-facing hillside known as 'La Louffe'.

The Mourvedre vines flourish on this terroir producing excellent wines that are powerful, tannic and fruity. La Tourtine comprises 70–80% Mourvedre depending on the year.

France;Domaine Jean-Louis Chave is a family owned winery. It has been passed from father to son since 1481. The Domaine is currently under the direction of Jean-Louis Chave, though his father, Gérard, is still around the domaine for occasional advice.When phylloxera hit in the 19th century, the family was obliged to move down to the Rhône valley to diversify into fruit farming, basing themselves in the village of Mauves where the cellars are today. It was at this time that a particularly smart ancestor decided to cross the Rhône river and lay claim to parcels of land on the hill of Hermitage.The vineyards used for Offerus are located in two distinct St. Joseph areas. The communities of Mauves, Tournon, and St. Jean de Muzols yields most of the blend. These southern vineyard sites express tightly wound tannins, spice, and power. They add structure and depth to complete the harmony of Offerus. 80% of this southern fruit comes from one of their own vineyards called Les Clos Florentin, which Jean Louis bought in 2009. These are old vines that were only worked by hand or by horse and grown biodynamically on granite. The remainder of the vineyards are located further north in communities around Serrieres. This soil produces wines which are more elegant, with incredible purity, definition, and focus.The wine is fermented in large, wood, open top fermenters and then finished in old oak demi-muids (just like the Domaine St. Joseph).;Rhone;Red;28.99;14.5;2015 Jean Louis Chave Offerus St. Joseph;Syrah / Shiraz;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/104685/bottle/754751/original.png;spice box,   cedar and   dark fruit;0.75;currant,   blueberry,   blackberry and   strawberry

Argentina;The Catena wines are a special assemblage of High Mountain Estate Vineyards made by fourth generation vintner, Laura Catena and chief winemaker, Alejandro Vigil. Although we have found that most of the Catena wines are consumed shortly after release, we are pleased to see that they age beautifully for ten to twenty years. Through decades of study and exploration within Mendoza's high altitude mountain terroirs, the Catena family has identified special locations for its Estate vineyards. From the marriage of these historic vineyards emerges a wine of unique character that has natural balance, concentration and a distinct varietal identity. This wine goes through an extensive cold maceration for 5 days at 48ºF (8,8ºC) to extract aromas. The juice is then fermented for 16 days with a post-fermentation maceration of 22 days. Wild Yeasts.

Ménage à Trois Red brings together three strange bedfellows: Zinfandel, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. To add complexity and retain character, each variety was fermented separately, then blended together prior to bottling. On top we’ve got Zinfandel, a saucy tease that brings blackberry and raspberry jam to the relationship. Merlot, with its generous mouth feel and red fruits, fits perfectly in the middle. The rich flavors and firm tannins of Cabernet Sauvignon make it the ideal candidate for the bottom layer of the trio.;California;Red;8.99;13.6;2016 Folie A Deux Menage A Trois Rouge;blend;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/104716/bottle/755334/original.png;candy,   vanilla,   oak,   smoke,   tar,   musk,   mushroom,   violet,   rose,   truffle,   earth,   coffee,   leather,   currant,   blackberry,   cherry,   cedar and   cigar box;0.75;jam,   blueberry,   black pepper,   cherry,   plum,   boysenberry,   cranberry,   licorice,   currant,   black cherry,   bell pepper,   olive,   oak,   smoke,   toast,   tar,   blackberry,   asparagus,   spice,   ginger and   vanilla

Jacques is guided by the talented Cyriaque Rozier, who makes the wine both here and at Château Fontanès. Though the property has responded to circumstance, its destiny seems irrevocably intertwined with its vines. Thirty-two of the Château’s eighty hectares are consecrated to terraced vineyard land with south-southeast sun exposure, on clay and limestone soils. This is unique terroir. Garrique, the aromatic scrub brush that dominates the landscapes of the South, asserts its presence among these vines. Syrah, Grenache, and Mourvèdre, the noble varietals that Jack Boutin planted here years ago, make up the reds. The whites include Viognier, Rolle, Grenache Blanc, Roussane and Marsanne.

France;"This southern facing estate is owned by the Pascal family.  It offers a unique plot of 12 acres, and it is one of the best Premier Crus of Givry. Founded in the 12th century by Cistercian monks, located in Givry, in the heart of historic Burgundy, mid-way between the abbeys of Cluny and Cîteaux, between Dijon and Mâcon, the Cellier aux Moines was established in the 12th century by Cistercian monks from the Abbey of La Ferté. <BR><BR>Drawing inspiration from the Cistercian heritage, striving for excellence and preparing the future, The Cellier aux Moines of Givry is a unique group of houses that has survived the vicissitudes of time. Having been the Abbey of La Ferté’s wine-producing property for nearly seven centuries, and then owned by the same family for two centuries following the French Revolution, it was purchased in 2004 by Philippe and Catherine Pascal and their three children, Camille, Marguerite and Alexis. From Beaune, to New York, then Reims, the family settles in Givry. After a long restoration, the Domaine went back to its original purpose: growing high quality grapes on an exceptional terroir, and producing the best possible wines. **Certified organic in 2016, practicing biodynamic**<BR><BR>Since the taking over of the Cellier’s vines in 2006, the property has stopped using herbicides and pesticides, returning to regular working and ploughing of the soil to encourage deeper roots, stimulate soil organisms, and let Nature take its course. This “rebirth” of the vineyard has seen a return of numerous flora and fauna with an impressive biodiversity: coveys of young partridges, hares, wild orchids… and numerous weeds, requiring manual hoeing.<BR><BR>The Cellier aux Moines is often the last property to harvest its grapes in the village of Givry. Nothing is better than the last rays of late summer sunshine to produce concentrated Pinot Noir grapes that are rich in sugar and aromas. Every year, four or five different plots are harvested separately depending on when they reach optimal ripeness, which is determined by the age of the vines and their location in the Clos. Picked using secateurs and placed carefully in ventilated crates, the grapes are immediately transported in the vat room in the Cellier where they are rigorously sorted. The vibrating sorting table enables the selection of only the perfectly ripe, healthy grapes for vinification.  Every vintage brings its share of surprises in terms of weather in this continental climate, which is suited to Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.

France;Aging has been extremely positive for this vintage. The color has deepened and given way to more complex aromas. The bouquet combines black fruit with a variety of spices such as vanilla, liquorice and cinnamon. Here we discover the beautiful aromatic palette of the 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon. Yet the evolution is most striking in the mouth. The wine gained body and fleshiness. It fills the palate. Notes of deeply ripened black cherry mingle with cocoa and mocha. It has a smooth finish, coating the palate with velvety tannins. The wine unfolds like lush velour fabric.

France;80% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc – the vines average 25 year old. The vineyards are on a plateau in the commune of Lussac Saint-Emilion, 5 miles north-east of the town of Saint-Emilion. Their excellent exposure ensures optimal ripeness of fruit and supple tannins. They enjoy an Atlantic climate, with humid winters, and warm, dry springs and summers. The soil is silt and sand, with a subsoil of clay mixed with traces of iron-oxide. The Merlot is harvested first, usually mid-September, followed by the Cabernet-Sauvignon late September.2 days of cold maceration for 10% of the volume, and then 3 weeks of maceration and fermentation, with indigenous yeasts. Aging in stainless steel tanks for 18 months, under a blanket of inert gas. The wine is assembled the February after the harvest and bottled in January. Pure, rich and savory fruit.In the spring of 1966, Roland Bel bought Château Cap de Merle, which at the time included a vineyard of 3 hectares. Today, the estate is run by his two sons, Alain and Jean-Marie, and the vineyards spread over 25 hectares.Farming practices: sustainable. Each vine has a fifty-year lifespan, and thus it is of utmost importance to protect its health for the long term. The vineyard is continuously monitored to ensure that enemies, such as parasites or fungi, are kept to a level below threat. For example, natural predators are encouraged to check the presence of larva from moths (cochylis and eudemis) whose eggs form tiny ruts on grape skins and thus enable the onset of grey rot. As a result of this practice, more intensive treatments are unnecessary.;Bordeaux;Red;14.99;12.5;2015 Chateau Cap De Merle Lussac St. Emilion;blend;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/104857/bottle/755139/original.png;violet,   rose,   truffle,   earth,   coffee,   leather,   currant,   blackberry,   cherry,   cedar,   cigar box,   tobacco,   broccoli,   berry and   flower;0.75;currant,   black cherry,   plum,   bell pepper,   olive,   oak,   smoke,   toast,   tar,   blackberry,   cherry,   asparagus,   spice,   ginger,   vanilla,   tobacco,   raspberry,   cassis,   violet,   pepper and   green bean
France;90% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc. The grapes come from a 13 ha vineyard planted with 30 year old vines at a density of 6,000 vines/ha. They enjoy a southern exposure. The soil is clay-limestone with a siliceous and clayey subsoil. The manual harvest is conducted according to each plot, grape variety, soil and exposure, and performed as late as possible to ensure optimum ripeness. In the cellar, the grapes are handled with meticulous care with two sorting tables. Carefully managed for each plot, a slow fermentation takes place with indigenous yeast, and without excessive temperature, to make sure that extraction proceeds gently. The château is using state of the art wooden upright tanks. The wine is aged 12 to 18 months in new French oak barrels. 1,200 cases produced. Deep purple color, lush aromas of cherry and vanillin oak. Good tannic structure and a long, well-balanced finish.A classic château property, the charming Château Roc de Candale is located east of Saint-Emilion’s celebrated limestone plateau in one of the region’s most desirable districts. The recently modernized estate shares its premium terroir with nearby Château Tertre Roteboeuf and La Mondotte.Château Roc de Candale probably owes its origins to Marguerite de Suffolk Kendall, a descendent of Edward III, King of England and Duke of Aquitaine. When she married Count Jean of Foix, he added the Count of Candale name to his other titles. At their table, the Count and Countess of Foix-Candale would serve wines from their lands in Saint-Emilion, already widely renowned at the time thanks to the strict quality rules set down by the Jurade of Saint-Emilion.Jean-Louis Vicard, President of the well-known Vicard Cooperage, purchased Château Roc de Candale in 2010. Stéphane Derenoncourt is the winemaker.Farming practices: sustainable. No herbicide or pesticide are used. Only contact treatments are applied with copper and sulfur.;Bordeaux;Red;31.99;13.0;2008 Chateau Roc Candale;blend;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/104866/bottle/755073/original.png;violet,   rose,   truffle,   earth,   coffee,   leather,   tobacco,   broccoli,   berry and   flower;0.75;currant,   black cherry,   plum,   bell pepper,   olive,   oak,   smoke,   toast,   tar,   tobacco,   raspberry,   cassis,   violet,   pepper and   green bean
France;The precocious second label, Fleur de Fonplegade is a blend of 95% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc – mostly from young vines, from 27 individual blocks spread over 7 levels of flat and terraced vineyards, all with different soils. It highlights the lush, generous and vibrant fruit of the clay/limestone terroir. With velvety tannins and terrific length, the quality of these vineyards is evident, being in close proximity to Château L’Arrosée, Canon-La-Gaffelière, Château Angélus, and Chateau Petrus. Vinification takes place in tronconic wooden vats over 20 days followed by 13 to 15 months in second use oak barrels. 1,900 cases made.In 2004, the historic Château Fonplegade, a Saint-Emilion Grand Cru Classé, was taken over by Stephen and Denise Adams, owners of Pomerol’s acclaimed Château l’Enclos and Napa Valley’s organically farmed White Cottage Winery. With a loving attention to detail, the winery and vineyards were completely renovated with the goal of bringing the domaine up to its previous high standard of quality. Starting with a rigorous improvement of the vineyards, all work is done by hand while high-density planting and green harvesting were instituted. With the 2009 vintage, they began a biodynamic farming program. As a result, yields have decreased by over 30% while fruit quality has greatly improved.;Bordeaux;Red;33.8;14.0;2010 Fleur De Fonplegade;blend;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/104867/bottle/755087/original.png;violet,   rose,   truffle,   earth,   coffee,   leather,   tobacco,   broccoli,   berry and   flower;0.75;currant,   black cherry,   plum,   bell pepper,   olive,   oak,   smoke,   toast,   tar,   tobacco,   raspberry,   cassis,   violet,   pepper and   green bean

France;In 2009, we launched a second wine from Chateau L'Enclos - Le Petit Enclos. As the second wine from this prestigious site, Le Petit Enclos is made to drink early, with forward fruit in the mouth and an elegant finish. Le Petit Enclos 2009 is a true small-lot wine with a production of only 8,000 bottles! The beautiful 2009 offers a lovely sweet toffee and black cherry perfume. It is ripe, medium-bodied, and displays a silky texture. Already providing a lot of pleasure, this wine will offer even more in the coming four to five years. The vines come from a 9ha vineyard on the western slope of Pomerol’s famous plateau. They average 40 year old and grow on silicious and gravel soil with layers of clay. The grapes are harvested by hand, at full ripeness. In the cellar, they are handled with meticulous care on two sorting tables. Traditional concrete tanks are used for both the maceration and fermentation. Cold maceration is undertaken at first for 5 days, then fermentation and hot maceration follow for 30 days in thermoregulated vats. The wine is then aged for 12 months in French oak barrels, 40% new and 60% one year old.Generous aromas of dark fruits, forest floor, sweet cherries and plums. Fine tannins and fresh finish. 700 cases producedOwned by Stephen and Denise Adams, Château l’Enclos is a 10 hectare property situated on the western slope of Pomerol famous plateau. It encompasses 38 plots across 3 terraces of the appellation. Neighbor of Château Clos René and with some plots near Château Le Pin, it enjoys a sandy-gravely surface soil with clay-iron subsoils.

United States;100% Pinot Noir from Wooldridge Creek Vineyard in Applegate Valley Rogue Valley AVA, Oregon. The Applegate Valley (within the Rogue Valley) is characterized by many micro-climates and high soil diversity. Long, warm days accompanied by very cool nights and a very low risk of precipitation leads to wines with great depth of flavor and complexity. Each vineyard in the Rogue Valley brings unique characteristics to their fruit because of the soil diversity and high altitude (1000-1500 feet). Wines coming from the right vineyards are powerful and extremely complex. More than 75% of the grapes use for this cuvée are actually LIVE certified.Deep, complex aromatics are accented by dark cherry and a touch of cranberry. Barrel aging (8 months in French oak, 30% new) lends vanilla notes and hints of baking spices to the flavor.

France;"Domaine Vacheron is one of Sancerre’s elite properties, producing Sancerre of amazing purity and definition.  The Vacheron cousins own 1 hectare of vines in the lieu-dit of Le Paradis. Their plot is on a steep south-facing slope with shallow limestone soils. The soil is so thin and poor that the vine roots grow deeply into fissures in the bedrock below. Le Paradis is an explosively aromatic wine, dense on the palate with a broad mineral character kept in check by a sinuous acidity that keeps things lively. Hand harvesteded, natural yeast fermentation in tank. Aged 12 months in wooden vats.<BR><BR>The domaine has been completely transformed over to biodynamic farming with two young cousins, Jean-Laurent and Jean-Dominique Vacheron, at the helm. No synthetic material is used in the vineyard, harvests are carried out exclusively by hand, and the only fertilizer used is produced from the compost pile. Yields are kept extremely low. Having inherited some of the most coveted parcels in the appellation, the cousins are trying a Burgundian approach to Sancerre winemaking, with parcels being vinified separately and blends varying from year to year. At the domaine, Pinot Noir is not an afterthought, but a focus, and on soils just a couple of hours west of Burgundy, they are making grand, expressive bottlings from the varietal. While the attention to detail, the natural farming and focused winemaking are important, it is the soil structure that really shines through in these wines. While much of Sancerre lies on chalk soils, much of the Vacheron estate is planted on silex, which is flint over a clay and limestone base. This silex soil contains millions of tiny oceanic fossils, giving evidence that the entire region was once covered by the ocean. It produces wines of amazing minerality and acidity, with trademark smoky aromas. The famed “Les Romains” and “Belle Dame” vineyards in Sancerre are made up exclusively of this soil type and the Vacheron family owns some of the more important holdings in these parcels. As Jean-Dominique was recently quoted in the Revue de Vin de France, “We have not yet seen the sum of what one can do with Sauvignon in Sancerre.” We can’t wait to see what’s coming next."" -Importer<BR><BR>""The 47 ha family estate is surely one of the finest Sancerre producers. Corresponding to Demeter, Biodyvin and Ecocert regulations for the past couple of years, three generations (with the two young cousins Jean-Laurent and Jean-Dominique Vacheron at the helm) cultivate their Sauvignon Blanc vines in the best limestone and/or silex sites and offer wines which are clear, precise and fresh but also pure, defined and thrillingly mineral and complex. Yields are kept extremely low here and harvest is done exclusively by hand. The cousins vinify (and partly bottle) their different parcels separately whereas the blend can vary from year to year. In contrast to most of the top producers in Sancerre the Vacherons cultivate their vines mostly on Silex (flint) soils which is to be found mainly in the eastern part of the appellation as well as in Pouilly-Fumé on the other side of the Loire river. This makes their wines firm, fresh if not piquant, very precise and rather vertical, even the reds.

Although Daniel had been an Atlantic fisherman by trade, the two jumped at the opportunity to start their new vocation in Valérie’s hometown. Such a leap of faith has not been without its struggles, however the Alibrands have been attracting quite a bit of attention for such newcomers. They farm seven hectares of vineyards in the village of Fargues, known for the eponymous and prestigious wine château to which their land runs adjacent. They are fortunate to have old vines, which impart fabulous complexity to the wine, although it means lower yields than are the norm for Sauternes. (The yields for Sauternes average around 25 hectolitres per hectare, however the Alibrands’ vines only get 10-13, like Yquem!) They started farming in lutte raisonnée but have recently begun the three-year conversion process to have their vineyards certified as organic.

With an existing winery and 3.5 hectares of old Gamay vines surrounding the house, everything was there for them to combine their wine project and family life.

A trained agronomist and oenologist, Cedric spent nearly 15 years working in the wine business before achieving his dream. Everything he does is hands on and natural; the results are purely-fruited, fresh Beaujolais that remarkably express all the richness of their exceptional terroir. Total production is around 30,000 bottles.The word “Capréoles” comes from the Old French and means vine tendrils.

France;The towering, regal Château de Brézé just outside of Saumur is not only a UNESCO World Heritage site but also, historically, an important reference in fine French wine. Lauded by King Réné Anjou in the 15th century classical literature, the Château de Brézé wines were regarded with such esteem that the royals exchanged them annually with the great Sauternes of Château d’Yquem. The vineyards belonging to the Château de Brézé entered a Renaissance of their own in 2009 when Count de Colbert conferred upon Arnaud Lambert management of the viticultural estate. Arnaud immediately converted the entire 25 hectares to organic methods, with official certification as of the 2012 vintage. This movement stems first and foremost from the desire to express each individual Clos in its purest, most vibrant form.Brézé is a unique site due to its relatively high elevation and eminently nuanced geological profile. The high composition of tuffeau, a porous, chalky limestone also used in the construction of much of the Loire’s Renaissance architecture, results in finely mineral Chenin Blanc and Cabernet Franc. Clay and sand also lend themselves to the diversity of the terroirs, giving body to the reds and richness to the whites. With five historic and clearly delimited Clos to work with, Arnaud Lambert has the incredible opportunity to truly understand and reveal the distinctions within this extraordinary appellation.;Loire;Red;26.99;13.0;2014 Chateau De Breze Saumur Rouge Clos Du Tue Loup;Cabernet Franc;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/105162/bottle/755578/original.png;tobacco,   broccoli,   berry and   flower;0.75;tobacco,   raspberry,   cassis,   violet,   pepper and   green bean

United States;The foundation for the 2015 Carneros Pinot Noir is Frank Family’s Lewis Vineyard, located in the heart of Napa-Carneros, near the shores of the San Pablo Bay. It is made up of 78 acres planted on gently rolling hills, with 68 acres planted to Chardonnay and 10 acres planted to Pinot Noir. The predominant maritime influence of the Pacific Ocean creates the cool temperature, fog and wind that make Carneros ideally suited for growing cool climate varietals. The Lewis Vineyard consists primarily of shallow and dense clay loam soils, receiving only 20 inches of rainfall annually. The restricting soils result in extremely low yields, producing grapes with strong character and balanced acidity. The wine has a beautiful ruby color.

In fact, these famous stones are found here in the sub-soil. The vines are more than 50 years old and are situated in the finest part of the appellation.<BR><BR>This historic estate was established in 1834. Claude de Nicolay took over from her mother as winemaker in 1988 and crafts traditionally styled wines from one of the Côte d'Or's great terroirs, the hill of Corton and its surrounding villages.  Corton is just north of Beaune and it's easy to spot, as it's a big hill with a forest on top. It's a limestone outcropping that is set apart from the main ""cote"" of the Cote de Beaune or Côte de Nuits. It is a bit of an anomaly in the Côte d'Or as the Grand Cru are named after the hill, rather than attached to a specific village. Three villages have vineyards that are a part of Corton: Aloxe, Ladoix, and Pernand-Vergelesses. Corton is the only place with red Grand Cru in the Côte de Beaune. <BR><BR>At Chandon de Briailles, the vineyard management has been fully biodynamic since 2005 and organic since 1998. Claude's brother, Francois de Nicolay joined the domaine in 2001. <BR><BR>John Gilman (View From the Cellar) wrote: “This domaine is quickly becoming one of the very finest to be found anywhere in the Côte D’Or...these are great, classically styled, terroir-driven red and white Burgundies that age brilliantly, and are among the treasures to be found in the Côte de Beaune for those adventurous enough to try a few bottles.”-Importer";Burgundy;Red;57.58;13.0;2015 Domaine Chandon De Briailles Savigny Les Beaune Les Lavieres 1er Cru;Pinot Noir;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/105309/front/755593/original.png;barnyard,   cherry,   plum,   game and   tomato;0.75;ripe cherry,   plum,   strawberry,   raspberry and   mushroom

France;It says a lot about an estate when their “current release” is from a harvest over four years prior. Given that the Portalis clan never employs de-stemming, the wines—built nearly entirely on the back of the thick-skinned Mourvedre—do benefit from extended time in cask, which allows those ferocious young tannins to relent and soften a bit. Much is made of the tannic nature of young Pradeaux, but they are always honest tannins—derived from fruit and plant matter, not from force of extraction or the power of new oak. And, needless to say, it is precisely this firm structure which allows the wines to blossom into awe-inspiring cellar treasures with time.

Eager to let the vineyard speak for itself, Joey produces vineyard designated Syrah wines that from day one, have been well received on the market.  For his first vintage, Joey produced 100 cases, while serving as the assistant winemaker at Beckmen Vineyards, where he was given space to launch his own label.Three years later, in 2001, Joey relocated to Buellton, CA to open his own winery, producing 750 cases of wines that immediately appeared on some of the country’s top wine lists.  This same year, Matt Kramer added two of Tensley’s 2001 Syrah wines to the Wine Spectator’s Top Ten Wines in the World list.  An auspicious beginning for a young vintner?  Absolutely!

United States;"Smith-Madrone is a family-run estate-bottled winery dedicated to producing fine wines exclusively from its own vineyards. In 1971, 200 acres were purchased high atop Spring Mountain, west of St. Helena, in the Napa Valley. One of most beautiful appellations of the Napa Valley, the Spring Mountain District was recognized by the B.A.T.F. in May of 1993. Charles and Stu built the winery by hand, using stones and lumber from the property. A cellar and the main floor house French and American barrels. The roof of the building is used for entertaining. It has stunning 360-degree views of the floor of the Napa Valley and the Sierra Nevada Mountains in the distance, as well as of Smith-Madrone's own steep dry-farmed vineyards. Another striking historical and visual note is the dramatic corridor of 22 Picholine olive trees which descend the slope below the winery into the vineyards. More than a hundred and twenty years old, these trees were carefully preserved when the vineyards were re-planted. Their huge proportions (some stretch as tall as 35 feet) are a testament to their struggle for precious mountain sunlight.Smith-Madrone is located at elevations between 1,300 and 1,900 feet; the vineyards straddle slopes of up to 35%. The vines flourish in vividly red and rocky volcanic soil known as Aiken loam, which is well-drained and friable. In exploring the property before purchasing it, Stuart Smith discovered old grape stakes interspersed with the tall trees, evidence of a vineyard planted in the 1880s and abandoned with the onset of Prohibition. Douglas fir, oak, redwood and madrone trees were cleared, and the vineyards planted. The year 1972 marked the beginning of the vineyard itself with the planting of Chardonnay, Riesling, Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot Noir (the last grafted to Chardonnay in 1989). Unusual for North Coast viticulture at the time, the initial twenty acres were planted on their own roots. The cooler mountain climate is an additional factor which produces grapes of intense flavor, structure and longevity. Today the vineyard consists of 38 acres in various stages of production dating back to 1972.

France;The vineyards for Silène are hillside vineyards located in Larnage and Gervans. It is rare for Crozes to come from hillside granitic soil, as most of Crozes is situated on the alluvial valley floor. The granite soil produces a wine with more backbone and structure. The idea behind this Crozes is to balance the fruit of Syrah without compromising the tightness given by the granite. 50% of the Crozes comes from a parcel of young vines planted in 2003 and owned by Domaine Jean Louis Chave. The parcel sits on a beautiful terroir on the rear east-facing flank of the Hermitage hill. The blend continues to evolve as Lean-Louis buys more land in Crozes.Vinification:The grapes are vinified at the Domaine using indigenous yeasts in wood tonneaux and stainless steel tanks, then aged for 15-18 months in barriques.Tasting Notes:Ripe fruit balanced out by backbone and structure, this Syrah shows plum, black pepper, pencil lead, and warming spices.

Italy;After  an  unusual  year  in  2014,  2015  proved  to  be  a  very  normal  wine-making  year,  almost  textbook.    After  a  normal winter, wet and mild but with some days below 0°,  germination arrived on time during the first few days of April.  Spring was characterized, by dry and sunny weather, ideal conditions for normal vegetative growth that led  to  quick  and  full  flowering  at  the  end  of  May.    From  June  water  stress  steadily  arrived.    July  will  be  remembered  as  particularly  scorching  hot  and  dry,  with  temperature  highs  consistently  above  30°C  on  every  single day of the month.  The heat wave, together with the lack of rain gave rise to fearing that ripening would be blocked and that early harvest would be necessary.  Fortunately the rain arrived around 10th August with heavy rainfall that unblocked the ripening process, bringing with it some much fresher weather during the final phase of ripening.  This cooler but sunny weather lasted for the entire harvesting period, allowing us to harvest very slowly, waiting to make sure that every vineyard had arrived at the perfect point in the maturing phase, uniting a fresh and lively aromatic quality with a perfect phenolic maturity with plenty of tannins yet still silky and soft.

United States;"The Chardonnay program at Failla continues to evolve, as is demonstrated by their Sonoma Coast Chardonnay. The growth of this wine is due to the purchase of a new vineyard. Additionally, maturing vines and improved farming along with a more complex elevage all combine to provide their highest quality wine yet. Upon acquiring the Olivet Vineyard in 2011, full conversion to organic farming was implemented to ensure the highest quality of fruit. Another core blending component comes from the young vine block at Keefer Ranch,which was planted to heirloom Wente selection per Ehren’s suggestion in 2002.

Italy;The Cartacanta cuvée, Agricola Basile’s entry level wine, impeccably expresses of the qualities of the Sangiovese grape used for this wine (90%, complemented with 10% Merlot). In the vineyard, yields are kept very low and do not exceed 1.5 kg of grapes per vine. The harvest is done manually and in small crates to prevent any damages to the fruit.

France;"Importer Neil Rosenthal's first imported vintage of Domaine du Nozay’s flagship cuvee shows impressive complexity. Fermented naturally and raised entirely in small stainless steel tanks. To understand his vineyards as intimately as possible, Cyril vinifies and ages each individual parcel separately (no matter how small) and blends only before the time of bottling—a painstaking regimen. With a broad, flinty mineral core of palate-staining intensity, this cuvee positively bristles with energy, a testament to its supremely healthy biodynamically wrought grapes of origin. The fruit here stops well short of overt Sauvignon Blanc gooseberry, offering notes of lime zest, musk melon, and salty peach on a bright but not squeaky-sterile frame. <BR><BR>It’s refreshing to encounter a Sancerre that shows excellent typicity yet speaks more of the rocks beneath the soil than the fruit suspended above it.<BR><BR>The fifteen-hectare Domaine du Nozay lies at the northernmost extreme of the appellation—a contiguous and steep bowl of vineyards just outside the town of Sainte-Gemme-en-Sancerrois. Purchased back in 1971, the ambitious Philippe de Benoist purchased the stunning 17th-century Chateau du Nozay and began planting vines around the property.  Today, his son Cyril runs the operation with boundless enthusiasm and effusive intelligence. In fact, Cyril is a nephew of the legendary Aubert de Villaine of Domaine de la Romanée Conti (his mother Marie-Helène is Aubert’s sister), so perhaps that visionary spirit runs in his bloodstream. In an appellation in which it is so easy—and, perhaps, tempting—to produce wine with a minimum of effort and rely on its famous name to sell it, Cyril’s restless pursuit of his terroir’s deepest possible expression is admirable. The entire property is farmed organically, and Cyril is converting gradually to biodynamics (with certification in place for 2018); employs only spontaneous fermentations; and the wines are not rushed into bottle, instead spending much of those warm spring and summer “selling months” being nourished by their fine lees.<BR><BR>In terms of terroir, the micro-climate of Sainte-Gemme is a far cry from Bué and Chavignol. Whereas the latter two villages tend to produce Sancerre of ample fruit, clear varietal typicity, and intense concentration, Sainte-Gemme’s wines are a bit more feistily mineral-driven, a bit more marked by earth—it is perhaps no accident that Sainte-Gemme is the closest village to Chablis in terms of physical proximity. Domaine du Nozay’s wines show clear Sauvignon Blanc character, certainly, but a compelling underlay of chalk dust and fresh soil provide a fascinating contrast to the more regally poised and classically “Sancerre” offerings of Crochet. The patient student of terroir comes to realize over time that appellation boundaries are not strict limits, and that expressions at the fringes tend to bleed into one another. As lifelong devotees of this field of study, we are thrilled to welcome such a source into our family of growers—a new timbre of voice in France’s endlessly enchanting choir."" -Importer";Loire;White;24.98;12.5;2016 Domaine Du Nozay Sancerre;Sauvignon Blanc;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/105752/bottle/756175/original.png;apple,   pear,   kiwi,   citrus,   stone,   grapefruit and   melon;0.75;grass,   gooseberry,   grapefruit,   lime,   melon,   citrus,   mineral and   flint

Sharing the same magical corner of northern Montalcino with luminaries such as Casanova di Neri, Il Marroneto's history is relatively young, dating back to the late 1970s when Alessandro's father bought prized vineyard property and immediately got to work, releasing their first Il Marroneto Brunello in 1980.

Italy;Andrea Cortonesi, the founder, proprietor, vigneron and winemaker for the Uccelliera estate, was also running his own restaurant in Siena called Il Casato. It was in his capacity as restaurateur that the Voliero label was born, from vineyards 200 meters higher in elevation than Uccelliera, and produces classic Montalcino Brunello. It combines two high altitude vineyards of Castelnuovo and Sant’Angelo, and plays on the elegance, finesse and brightness that its elevation imparts.<BR><BR>Now in its 11th year of production, some things have changed at Voliero, but most have remained the same. Production is still very limited, with only about 600 cases of Brunello produced each year. The vinification, as always, has been fairly traditional: spontaneous fermentation in temperature controlled stainless steel with fermentation/maceration lasting about 20 days. The wine then goes into large Slavonian oak casks of 20 hectoliters and larger for 30 months.<BR><BR>In 2010, Antonio Galloni was visiting the estate and tasted the Voliero wines. He flipped:  “...a fascinating contrast to Cortonesi’s wines from Uccelliera, which of course come from the southern part of the zone. This is a taut, energetic wine that shows off the dazzling freshness and vibrancy typical of this part of Montalcino. It is an impeccable, totally refined Brunello, especially when compared with the decidedly wilder, more sauvage Brunello from Uccelliera...”  With such high praise, even though Cortonesi had not intended Voliero for export, the wines immediately found an audience, especially in the U.S.  Importer Michael Skurnik was among the first in the United States.;Tuscany;Red;52.97;13.5;2013 Voliero Brunello Di Montalcino;Sangiovese;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/105844/bottle/756492/original.png;asparagus,   green pepper and   red fruit;0.75;red fruit,   strawberry and   raspberry

Some 15% of the clusters fermented whole in open vats. It has a ripe nose without excess, with notes of sour cherries and some flowers. Quite aromatic. The palate is gentle but with power.

France;"The Le Meurger name stems from the word “meurs” (walls), constructed to mark out a property, or built along the edges of plots from stones extracted from the fields. These walls were called “murgers” or “les meurgers,” and with that in mind, we seek to distinguish our entry into the category of Burgundy as more than just a price point. The wines are textbook examples of what their label declares, and no well-versed palate in Burgundy can deny their provenance, or quality, for the money involved.

France;"Rodolphe Raffault of Domaine Jean-Maurice Raffault replanted and revived Clos de L’Hospice, one of Chinon’s greatest sites, in 2008. Raffault has cultivated the Clos fully organically since the replanting. This extraordinary, one-hectare vineyard is a steeply sloped natural amphitheater with limestone soil. It faces south-east, overlooking the Vienne River, opposite the Château de Chinon. Once owned by Rabelais’ descendants, the Clos was highly prized in times past and was regularly mentioned in historical documents. It belonged to the convent of Calvarian and Augustinian nuns from the 17th century through the French Revolution, where it served as a source of income for their hospital – hence its name: the Clos de L’Hospice. Preferring to tend to their vegetables, in 1876 the sisters allowed local vignerons to maintain the vineyard. The nuns kept the wine in poor vintages for their patients’ consumption at the Hospice and sold off the good years at profit. This arrangement continued until the vineyard was devastated during the Phylloxera epidemic.<BR><BR>Despite various projects, the Clos remained unplanted with vines until 2008. Amazingly enough, up until the 1980s, the land was used as a garden by hospital patients. The hospital relocated in 1980 and sold the land, which enabled the Clos de L’Hospice to eventually become a vineyard once again. In 2008, Rodolphe Raffault revived the site for his domaine in cooperation with the town of Chinon and an investment group who had undertaken the renovation of the Château – itself a national historic monument – along with the construction of new residences at the site of the former convent. In 2008, Raffault planted 0.65 hectares in the Clos with pre-WWII selection massale Cabernet Franc vines to attain a vineyard that is as close as possible to the original. In June of 2014, he planted the remaining one-third of a hectare of vines on limestone terraces. The first vintage was 2011.<BR><BR>The 2015 harvest took place under ideal, sunny conditions. Warm September days ensured optimal maturity. The Clos’ limestone soil mitigiated hyrdric stress due to the summer’s high temperatures and prevented over-concentration, even though the berries were generally smaller than usual. Raffault again picked the Clos last on October 9th, two weeks after the harvest of his Les Galuches and several days after the Les Picasses and Clos d’Isoré. The Clos de L’Hospice fruit was perfectly healthy, in part due to Raffault’s meticulous vineyard work including leaf stripping and green harvesting by hand. The grapes were harvested by hand and given a long, one-month maceration period followed by frequent remontages. The 2015 vintage was aged in three new 500 litre barrels, for 12 months. After the malolactic fermentation in cask finished, Raffault did not add sulfites and also chose not to rack the young wine. Rather, it remained protected under the natural CO2 produced by the malolactic fermentation. Before assemblage in early 2017, Raffault replaced the CO2 with inert gas to prevent any oxidization. Sulfites were not used during any phase. The 2015 Clos de L’Hospice was bottled on February 2, 2017.<BR><BR>Jean-Maurice Raffault and Rodolphe Raffault’s family began cultivating vines in Chinon 14 generations ago, when their ancestor, Mathurin Bottreau, bought his first parcel of vines in 1693.

What if we went even bigger? For the 2015 Experiment P5.5, we decided to age the wines in the standard 225L barrels for the first year and then blend and transfer the wines to 500L puncheons for the second year.

France; The finest white I’ve tasted from this estate is unquestionably the 2016 Châteauneuf-du-Pape Blanc Gallimardes and it should be snatched up by savvy readers. Loaded with notions of white peach, buttered citrus, spice and loads of crushed rock-like minerality, it’s rich, layered and textured, yet also vibrant and pure. Bravo! This estate has been run flawlessly by Marie Giraud for more than a decade now and the estate is consistently in the top handful of domaines in each vintage. She’s excelled in the more difficult 2015 vintage, and has produced some of the wines of the vintage in 2016.

France;"As the importer European Cellars puts it, ""One only needs to glance briefly through the notes of Jancis Robinson, Robert Parker, Andrew Jefford and David Schildknecht (among many others) to discover their love affair with the Languedoc. And by that, we mean head-over-heels, butterflies-in-the-stomach kind of love. We have had affection for the region since the humble beginnings of European Cellars when our motto was “unknown…and unsold” – an affection that remains as exciting to us today as it did 25 years ago.Château Puech-Haut has been on the critic’s radar for some time – which makes sense since the property has employed Michel Rolland, Claude Gros and now Philippe Cambie as consulting enologist. Visionary owner Gérard Bru spares no expense in his quest for excellence. Located quite close to Pic Saint-Loup, in Saint-Drézéry, Puech-Haut is near the far western border of the Rhône valley and benefits from both its proximity to the Mediterranean and the rugged, mountainous interior of France. There are slightly over 50 hectares planted with Grenache, Syrah, Mourvedre, Cinsault, Carignan, Viognier, Marsanne, Roussanne, Grenache Blanc and Carignan Blanc.

The château has been built beginning of the 18th century, and was the residence of the Marquis de Calvimont, political and military family from Normandy. It was often visited by the Duc de Richelieu, Minister of Louis XV. With the purchase came Château du Mayne, which Xavier and Caroline are renting. Xavier had been working in Château de Cerons with his father Jean Perromat since 1981 (the Perromat family has been in the Bordeaux region since the 16th century) and Caroline had been working at Château Haut-Bailly, Cru Classé de Pessac Léognan, for 15 years.Now they are focusing their efforts on the management of the vineyard, the planting of Merlot vines surrounding the château and the renovation of the cellar (new equipment and temperature control system).;Bordeaux;White;19.99;12.5;2015 Chateau Du Mayne;blend;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/106351/bottle/756705/original.png;apricot,   quince,   honey,   pineapple,   cream,   apple,   pear,   kiwi,   citrus,   stone,   grapefruit,   melon,   lemon,   honeysuckle,   spice,   floral,   orange,    floral,    peach and    honey ;0.75;fig,   lemon,   pear,   saffron,   grass,   bell pepper,   gooseberry,   grapefruit,   lime,   melon,   citrus,   mineral,   flint,   apple,   apricot,   acidic,   orange,    floral,    peach and    honey

Deep and fresh flavors of ripe plum, fruitcake, and black cherries are highlighted by notes of cedar and spice. Château Le Caillou represents exceptional value for a Pomerol of this caliber. 2600 cases produced.This seven hectare estate owes its name to the land registry designation of the vineyards. For over a century it belonged to the Bélivier family. Gérard Bélivier had no children, and in 1972 he handed down La Tour du Pin Figeac and his Pomerol cru, Château Le Caillou, to Lucien Giraud and his family. Both properties are currently managed by André Giraud, with the help of his wife Sylvie and their two sons, Stéphane and Laurent.

France;80% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Franc – the vines average 40 years. The vineyard’s clay-sand-limestone soil is ideal for the ripening of the Merlot grape. The wine is vinified and matured in stainless steel tanks to preserve the fruit and to ensure that it remains fresh and accessible. Due to the maturity of the fruit, maceration is carried out gently over two weeks with only one daily pumping-over, so as not to extract harsh tannins. The key to the exceptional quality lies in the location: on the hills above the Dordogne River, nearby the finest sites of Fronsac, St-Emilion and Pomerol. Château Gobert has a dark purple color, a soft texture and pleasing ripe Merlot aromas and flavors – dark plums, cherries and spice. Ready to be enjoyed when young, but with enough depth to complement heartier dishes.Château Gobert is a 16 hectare property located in the village of Vérac, just outside the Fronsac appellation on the right-bank of Bordeaux. It is owned by Guy Michoux, whose great-grandparents founded the estate in 1920. The vineyard’s clay-sand-limestone soil is ideal for ripening the Merlot grape, which is the principal variety in Château Gobert. The average age of the vines is 40 years.Farming practices: sustainable, moving toward organic.

About 2500 cases are produced.“It is a pleasant surprise to discover that Jean-Luc Thunevin, pioneer of garage wines, can produce, at an astonishing price, a wine that is as charming as it is subtle.” Eric Conan, L’Express.In 1989, Jean-Luc Thunevin and his wife, Murielle Andraud, acquired a small parcel of 0.6 hectare in the valley of Saint-Emilion, between Pavie-Macquin and La Clotte. And in 1991 the adventure of Valandraud began. Since then they acquired more properties in famous locations such as Saint-Sulpice de Faleyrens and Saint-Etienne de Lisse. 3 de Valandraud is the second wine (declassified fruit) of Thunevin's famous Valandraud and Virginie de Valandraud. The wine is very representative of Thunevin's signature style: lush and opulent forward fruit, with a silken, smooth tannic structure.JL Thunevin uses 100% new oak. His philosophy on new oak is that there is a reason used barrels are cheap... new oak is better but if the oak is not well integrated, the winemaker is at fault, not the oak (the same way that if a steak is burned, you would blame the chef, not the meat).Farming practices: No herbicides have been used since the 90’ and only a small amount of pesticides is used.

France;"This premier cru sits just south of Chenevottes and edges towards the center of the village. The Pillot parcel (0.28 hectare) was planted in 1951 with a portion replanted in 1988. The Macherelles is often the most generous and straight-forward of the 1er Crus in white.<BR><BR>Jean-Marc Pillot is the fourth generation of his branch of the Pillot family to tend vineyards in Chassagne Montrachet.

Of course, his father, Jean, remains by his side rendering advice and valuable assistance in the vineyards (often while he is tending the garden in back of the chai!). Jean-Marc has instituted several changes at the estate, the most prominent of which is the construction of a new cave. Of equal importance, Jean-Marc expanded the amount of vineyards under cultivation and has made subtle modifications in vinification and elevage to place his own “mark” on this estate which now covers approximately fifteen hectares with an annual production of, more or less, 60,000 bottles.<BR><BR>The domaine is dominated by its production of white wines but there are important cuvées of red wine produced here as well. Vineyard holdings are spread throughout the village of Chassagne with subsidiary parcels in Puligny, Santenay, Meursault and Remigny (to the south). This breadth of real estate enables the Pillot family to produce a stunning range of wines that put on brilliant display the intricacies of terroir in this southern tier of the Cote de Beaune. The estate’s jewels are its premier crus blancs (Baudines, Chenevottes, Macherelles, Vergers, Morgeot, Caillerets, La Maltroie and Champs Gain) and premier cru rouges (Macherelles, Morgeot, Clos St.Jean), all within the boundaries of Chassagne Montrachet. However, one should not overlook several gems that come from less exalted appellations, such as the Bourgogne Blanc “Grands Champs”, the Bourgogne Rouge “Grandes Terres”, and the expressive Santenay Rouge “Champs Claude”; and, of course, there are the fine village wines in both white and red from Chassagne. Jean-Marc also accesses grapes in very limited quantities from interesting appellations like his Montagny 1er Cru “Les Gouresses” and Saint Romain Blanc “La Perriere”.The vines in most parcels are between 25 and 50 years old; in certain instances the vines are considerably older, reaching the 100 year mark in Clos Saint Jean and Clos Saint Marc (within the cru of Vergers). Traditional viticultural practices are used in the vineyards. Both Cordon de Royat and Guyot Simple pruning and training systems are employed. The spring and summer months are the time for intensive work in the vineyards to control the size and quality of the harvest, the work including de-budding, leaf-control and, when necessary, the vendange en vert. The vineyards are plowed, no herbicides are used and planting is at high density (10,000 vines per hectare on the village level; 12,000 vines per hectare on the 1er Cru level).Harvest is manual.

The wines are aged on the fine lees for twelve months and then are racked out of barrel into stainless steel tanks to clarify and settle naturally for an additional six months. The extra aging avoids the necessity to cold stabilize the wine. The red wines are destemmed entirely; the grapes undergo a brief cold maceration (up to five days) and then the alcoholic fermentation covers 10 to 12 days with both remontage and pigeage being practiced daily during that period.

United States;"Di Costanzo Wines was founded with the 2010 vintage by owner and winemaker Massimo Di Costanzo. Massimo grew up in an Italian household in Berkeley, California – where wine, food and conversation were blended together during meals. When Massimo went to college (U.C. Davis) he did not initially enroll with the idea of becoming a winemaker. Rather he was interested in economics and business – but after enrolling in an introductory course to wine making and earning a very high grade in this class his interest was, as he says, ‘piqued by the process’ and he switched career paths ultimately graduating with a degree in wine making.<BR><BR>Post college wine making work took him oversees to a number of wine regions including to Italy, South Africa and Mendoza, Argentina. He learned how quality wines were made around the world and this experience gave him an international perspective on wine making. But ultimately he chose Napa as the region where he wanted to establish his own career. He had been drawn to well established producers making wines with restraint and finesse – including vintners such as Cathy Corison and Ric Foreman.<BR><BR>His first job in the Napa Valley was working at Provenance with winemaker Tom Rinaldi. In 2005 he met accomplished winemaker Andy Erickson and worked at what was a new winery at the time, Ovid on Pritchard Hill. Massimo then spent 2.5 years working with Andy as his assistant winemaker at Screaming Eagle (during what were exciting times at that vineyard with a winery redesign and a vintage that earned a remarkable score of 100 points from wine critic, Robert Parker).<BR><BR>He then left Screaming Eagle to work with winemaker Philippe Melka. But for many years his dream had been to establish his own brand. In 2008 and 2009 he purchased fruit from up valley (Oakville and St. Helena), made his own wine but did not release it commercially.<BR><BR>While looking for a winery to make his wine at, he was introduced to vintner Tom Farella. Massimo had already been familiar with Tom’s wines prior, and he recalls how well they tended to age. Looking to work with a cooler climate Napa Vineyard, Tom’s vineyard in the soon to be designated Coombsville appellation at the time seemed like a perfect fit. And timing was right – after the economic downturn of 2008 all of the sudden vineyards who were selling fruit to others had a surplus of grapes.<BR><BR>In 2010 Massimo was able to choose select blocks in the Farella Vineyard and has continued sourcing fruit from these same blocks. His first Farella Vineyard designate was merely 100 cases – today production has grown to typically between 300 to 400 cases a year. In 2016 Massimo expanded his vineyard portfolio to include the Rafael Vineyard in the western part of the Oak Knoll District.<BR><BR>The Farella Vineyard is one of Coombsville’s older vineyards – and contains the oldest Cabernet Sauvignon vines in the appellation. Massimo says “this vineyard makes the wines” – as a result he doesn’t have to do much manipulation once the grapes come into the winery. He picks at a reasonable brix – his wines from this vineyard have all natural acidity (no acidulation needed), he does not fine or filter and uses a minimum of SO2. The wine typically is aged in 50% new French Oak for 22 months and then receives another 6 months in bottle before being released.<BR><BR>The 2015, recently bottled at the time of our tasting is 100% varietal Cabernet Sauvignon. A warmer vintage with lower yields – this wine is remarkably very approachable in its youth. Shows dark fruit with a ruby purple color in the glass. The bouquet is well layered and continues to reveal a diversity of aromas as it opens. It shows attractive aromatics including sweet blackberry and plum notes along with a dry dust nuance, a kiss of mocha and a perceptible note of tobacco. Reveals both ripe aromatics yet is elegant at the same time. Tom Farella says his vineyard produces “an abundance of fine-grained tannins – and this wine certainly shows this structure on the finish.

United States;From a windswept vineyard on a rocky hill above the Sonoma Raceway, not far from San Francisco Bay, this is certainly wild. Winemaker Scott Rich’s use of whole-bunch fermentation and extended maceration and elevage emphasize savory, rooty notes of turmeric and ginseng. That earthy savor buzzes with energy in the end, coastal acidity driving those earthy flavors upward, so they seem to float and circulate like smoke in a jazz club, while the fruit becomes plump, warm and racy all at once.

It spends a year in 50hl foudres before a year in 228L barrel.  Its approach is silky from the fine tannins and it bears a color of garnet red with a hint of ruby, a seductive wine of great elegance. Certified organic.<BR><BR>Our first encounter with the 2015 “Emilien” was backin the autumn of 2016, a sample drawn from a well-weathered 50-hectoliter foudre—the kind of vessel inwhich each vintage spends its first full year of elevage.Even in its incomplete state, the 2015 was totallyravishing, and the two times we’ve checked in on itpost-bottling have more than confirmed our initialimpression of its greatness. After a string of fairlychallenging vintages in the region, the impulse toreally lean into the fabulously healthy raw material of a harvest like 2015 was understandable, andsure enough there will be plenty of heavily extracted, color-saturated, monolithic 2015 red Bordeauxfloating around the marketplace. Emilien is not one of them, as the Amoreaus treated the harvest’sbeautiful fruits as they always do, allowing nature’s generosity to speak unencumbered. Aromatically,the 2015 Emilien rises from the glass in commanding, stately fashion, neither overly exuberant norgarishly fruit-forward, yet deep and inviting and truly dazzling. It’s a nose that cannot be faked—anose of breed and lift that belies its makers’ complete trust in the health of their fruit and the naturalprocesses that, without coercion or sculpting, transform it into wine. Bordeaux these days has toofew such aromatic encounters. On the palate, the ample fruit of the vintage speaks in a rich JamesEarl Jones baritone, authoritative but controlled, and clear as a bell. It unfolds in waves, held in formby the glistening acidity that characterizes Le Puy in every vintage even as it reveals its myriadnuances of flavor and inner-mouth perfume. From palate to swallow to finish, it is so totallyseamless as to almost defy belief, and one cannot imagine any way in which it could be furtherperfected. 85% Merlot, 14% Cabernet Sauvignon, 1% Carmenere.<BR><BR>The estate is situated on the same plateau as Saint Emilion and Pomerol and sits on the second highest point in the Gironde at 110 meters above sea level (approximately 350 feet).

The average age of the vines is 50 years and no synthetic treatments have ever been used at the estate, which is certified biodynamic.<BR><BR>Harvest is manual, the grapes are entirely destemmed and the cuvaison is long, continuing for two to four weeks.  Only indigenous yeast is utilized, no chapitalisation is done nor is SO2 used during the fermentation.  The “elevage” of the Le Puy wines is done according to the lunar rhythm.

Rioja, with its excellent climate and soils, had already attracted attention, and experiments with Bordeaux-style vinification and barrique-aging were proving very successful. The region’s only real disadvantage was its remoteness, cut off from the lucrative markets to the north by the same mountains that ensured its favorable climate.

It was in the early 1980’s that Didier’s father had the foresight and began the push to harvest only balanced and ripe grapes, with up to 11 degrees of natural potential alcohol or more. This allowed the family to completely eliminate chaptalization, block malolactic fermentation, and use a generally very low dosage across the range. Most of the wines are vinified in stainless steel tanks and aged for a minimum of 36 months on the lees, with most aging for much longer before release.<BR><BR>Tasting through the remarkable range of Didier’s wines, there exists the classic virile qualities of Le Mesnil that has made this village so famous and lauded around the world.  However, they also possess their own unique personality that come from the singular vision of the Vergnon family to push for high quality fruit at harvest and minimal intervention in the cellar. It is this combination of exceptional terroir and inspired winemaking vision that has caught the attention of the world’s Champagne enthusiasts. This family tradition has been further strengthened by Clement and Didier partnering with the young and talented enologist Julian Goût.

Until 1978, Daniel sold his wine to Burgundian negociants. In the late seventies, his sons joined the business, bringing new parcels of vines with them.

The estate’s old vines, from 25 to 65 years old, were selected for the quality of their fruits: small berries with thick skins that guarantee deeply colored, complex wines with refined tannins. The small output of the estate allows the winemaker to select grapes of great quality, naturally concentrated and balanced. New plantings are carried out with seedlings selected for the small size of the berries they will produce. Harvest is carried out exclusively by hand.

France;"This famous house was founded as Renaudin-Bollinger & Cie. in 1829, by partners Jacques Bollinger and Paul-Joseph Renaudin. Its history can be traced back even further, however, as Bollinger and Renaudin had a third partner, the Comte de Villermont, whose family had settled in the village of Cuis in 1650. In 1750, the de Villermont family purchased the estate in Aÿ that still houses the Bollinger offices today, at 16, rue Jules Lobet, and records show that the family owned vines and was already producing sparkling wines in the 18th century. The Bollinger and de Villermont families would later become further entwined, as Jacques Bollinger eventually married Louise-Charlotte de Villermont, the daughter of the Comte de Villermont, in 1837. Bollinger and Renaudin focused on export markets from the very beginning, selling wine in England as early as 1832, as well as in Germany, Russia and Scandinavia. In 1847, Bollinger bought out de Villermont’s shares, re-establishing Renaudin-Bollinger as a private company. Paul-Joseph Renaudin died in 1851, and in 1854 the business entered fully into the hands of Jacques Bollinger. Out of respect, however, he retained the name Renaudin-Bollinger & Cie., and this name would remain on the house’s labels all the way until the early 1960s. The house received a Royal Warrant from Queen Victoria in 1884, which would be renewed by successive monarchs all the way through the present day. Jacques Bollinger passed away in the same year, and the company was taken over first by his son Joseph, and later another son Georges. Joseph Jacques Marie Bollinger took over the house in 1918, following the death of his father Georges, and upon Jacques’s death in 1941, his widow Lily Bollinger took the helm, managing the company until 1971. Madame Bollinger would become a tremendously influential figure, directing Bollinger with astuteness, energy and charm, and it was she who established the character and reputation of the house in the modern day. Upon her retirement, her nephew Claude d’Hautefeuille took charge, and after him another nephew, Christian Bizot, who would establish the house’s famous Charter of Ethics and Quality. Ghislain de Montgolfier, a great-great-grandson of Jacques Bollinger, took charge of the house from 1994 to 2008, and today, Jérôme Philipon is managing director, while Mathieu Kauffmann (pictured), who has been with the house since 2001, is Bollinger’s chef de cave. Bollinger’s 160 hectares of vines provide for roughly two-thirds of the house’s needs, which ensures a certain consistency in both style and quality. The current production is roughly 2.5 million bottles a year, and while the new winery in Aÿ can comfortably accommodate a production of up to three million bottles, the house isn’t seeking to increase production for the time being, as they feel that maintaining the high percentage of estate-grown grapes is crucial to their success. Fermentation is carried out either in stainless steel tanks or in oak barrels between 200 and 400 liters in size, and whether tank or barrel is used depends on the individual wine, as Bollinger vinifies a wide array of villages and parcels separately. However, all wines used for the prestige cuvée La Grande Année are vinified in wood, as are all wines destined for storage as reserves. According to the house, the wines made in stainless steel always go through malolactic, while the wines in wood are left to do as they like—some barrels will go through malo while some barrels will not. In certain vintages, such as 1995 and 1988, the malo simply doesn’t start, and there is nothing done to encourage it. Bollinger stores its reserve wines in magnum bottles, an extremely labor-intensive process that few houses are willing to undertake, and certainly no others on this scale. Between 70,000 and 80,000 magnums of wine are put aside each year, and there is a total stock of about 500,000 magnums in the reserve cellar, comprising perhaps ten different villages and ten different vintages. The wine is bottled with a touch of yeast and sugar to give it just a little sparkle (1.5 bars of pressure), as a means to keep it fresher for a longer period of time, and all of the magnums are bottled with natural cork."" -Peter Liem, Champagne Guide";Champagne;White;47.98;12.0; Bollinger Brut Special Cuvee;blend;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/17320/bottle/747450/original.png;barnyard,   cherry,   plum,   game,   tomato,   apple,   pear,   peach,   apricot,   lemon,   lime,   orange,   pineapple,   kiwi,   butter,   cream,   vanilla and   flower;0.75;ripe cherry,   plum,   strawberry,   raspberry,   mushroom,   apple,   pear,   peach,   apricot,   lemon,   lime,   orange,   pineapple,   kiwi,   butter,   cream,   vanilla and   flower

France;"90% Gamay, 10 % Poulsard. Pet-Nat.  Bugey is one of the best-kept secrets of France. As a geographical crossroads between the Savoie, the Jura, Burgundy, and the Rhone, it is one of the few regions where one can see both palm trees and snow within eyeshot. It is adjacent to the Savoie on its western side, located in between Lyon, Grenoble, and Geneva. The wines of Bugey were first cultivated here by the Romans and were later resuscitated by the medieval monks. Still, the region had to wait until 2009 before receiving its own A.O.C. status. Today, Cerdon is considered one of three crus within the appellation of Bugey, and the only one whose entire production consists of sparkling wine. In La Cueille, one of seven high-altitude hamlets surrounding the historic medieval town of Ponsin, Patrick and Catherine Bottex are farming the limestone slopes above the Ain River. They have been working five hectares of land since 1991 and produce only a small quantity of their beautiful, intriguing sparkling wine. As a former part of the Duchy of Burgundy, it stands to reason that several Burgundian grape varietals have found a home here—not the least of which is Gamay. The Bottex’s blend consists of ninety percent Gamay and ten percent of the native Poulsard. They bottle this low-alcohol wine using the methode ancestrale, a rare technique that experts believe predates the méthode champenoise. The wine first goes through a primary fermentation in cuve, but is then bottled before all of the residual sugar has converted to alcohol. After going through a secondary fermentation in the bottle for at least two months, the wine is ready—Champagne’s dosage is not permitted! The resulting wine is delightfully refreshing with bright fruit, a beautiful rosé hue, and a touch of sweetness.Kermit had never heard of Bugey until Marcel Lapierre uncorked a beauty at one of his after-tasting parties.

Ployez-Jacquemart owns 2.15 hectares of Premier Cru and Grand Cru vineyards in Ludes and Mailly-Champagne in the Montagne de Reims, known for its classic chalk slopes. Laurence purchases Premier Cru and Grand Cru grapes from 12 hectares of vineyards from growers that the family has worked with for over 20 years. All of the work in the vineyards is done by hand, from the beginning of the growing season until the grapes are harvested. Only first press juice goes into the Ployez-Jacquemart wines. A light filtration is used for wines produced in vats, but no filtration is used on wines aged in wooden barrels. The wines undergo a very slow bottle fermentation in a 25 meter-deep cellar, giving them extremely fine bubbles. Wines are aged nose to punt, or sur pointe, in lieu of being aged on their side. Aging sur pointe provides the antioxidative and aging benefits of the lees while not allowing the wines to become too rich from the lees contact. When the wines are ready to be disgorged, after up to 12 years in the cellar, only a very minimal dosage is added, typically 3-4g/liter. Ployez-Jacquemart's goal is to leave the structure of each wine intact, allowing the true character and personality of the harvest to shine through. Unlike most producers in Champagne, she strives to keep the characteristic of each vintage even in her NV blends and only uses a very small amount of reserve wine, if any at all."" - <b>Importer</b>";Champagne;White;29.09;12.0; Ployez Jacquemart Extra Quality Brut;blend;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/54006/bottle/491761/original.png;barnyard,   cherry,   plum,   game,   tomato,   flower,   pear,   apple,   peach,   apricot,   lemon,   lime,   orange,   pineapple,   kiwi,   butter,   cream and   vanilla;0.75;ripe cherry,   plum,   strawberry,   raspberry,   mushroom,   flower,   pear,   apple,   peach,   apricot,   lemon,   lime,   orange,   pineapple,   kiwi,   butter,   cream and   vanilla

France;Lying on Pauillac’s Bages plateau, between the town of Pauillac itself and Saint-Julien-Beychevelle, Château Croizet-Bages also takes its name from its original creators, the Croizet brothers. One a court clerk, the other a local lawyer, the two men bought up parcels of vines from their neighbours duirng the first half of the 18th century and created their own successful vineyard. At the time of the Revolution, and much involved in local government, the brothers sold the estate to a family from Gascony, the Puyteracs, who in turn sold it to a Bordelais, Jean Calvé, just two years before the 1855 classification of the Médoc. The current proprietors, the Quié family, acquired Croizet-Bages in 1942 from American entrepreneur Jean-Baptiste Monnot (he bought the struggling estate at the end of WW1).

France;"The domaine's ""basic"" St-Veran is made from 40-50 year old vines. Thomas uses only the clearest juice from the pressing. Fermentation begins with the native yeasts and lasts for about 10 days; the temperature in the tanks is not allowed to exceed 22C. Full malolactic fermentation follows immediately after the first phase. The St-Veran is vinified and aged solely in stainless steel tanks on its fine lees (without any active stirring) for 7 months. It bursts with ripe and energetic green apple and citrus flavors and has a long and bright finish. Focus, clarity and intensity of fruit are the hallmark of Thomas' wines.<BR><BR>Domaine Thomas, created in 1934, now extends over 20 hectares on southwest-facing slopes, mostly in the Saint-Veran appellation town of Prisse. The Thomas family has been estate-bottling the majority of their production since 1987, specializing in St-Veran. Owner and winemaker Lucien Thomas seeks the fullest, pure and focused expression of fruit and terroir. His wines have been regularly acclaimed by the critics for their focus, purity and intensity. As early as 2004, The Wine Spectator did a full page feature profile on Lucien Thomas, applauding his exceptional technique and the elegant and pure style of his wines, which was exceptional for the time.<BR><BR>Thomas produces his St-Veran wines from 16 hectares of old Chardonnay vines planted on a remarkable, single-block, south-west facing amphitheater vineyard. This privileged, very sunny and heat-retaining location allows the grapes to attain perfect ripeness and concentrated flavors. The ideal soil is a stony, fast-draining mix of limestone and clay. Thomas plows his vineyards, prunes severely (vines are trained in the Guyot simple way) and uses organic fertilizer only if needed. He further controls yields by cluster-thinning and green harvesting. Thomas harvests by hand and the grapes enter the winery by gravity. After a gentle pneumatic pressing, the juice is allowed to clarify in tank at low temperature to become as clear as possible before the start of the alcoholic fermentation with the native yeasts."" - Importer";Burgundy;White;16.98;13.5;2015 Domaine Thomas Saint Veran;Chardonnay;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/95915/bottle/747445/original.png;apple,   pear,   peach,   apricot,   lemon,   lime,   orange,   pineapple,   kiwi,   butter,   cream and   vanilla;0.75;apple,   pear,   peach,   apricot,   lemon,   lime,   orange,   pineapple,   kiwi,   butter,   cream and   vanilla

The estate now covers 30 hectares of vineyards broken into several plots, with a different exposition, all on shallow siliceous clay soil and a subsoil of metamorphic rock (gneiss, ‎orthogneiss and amphibolites). The result is a range of highly individual “clos”: Le Clos de la ‎Févrie, Les Mauguitonnières, Les Gras moutons (Saint-Fiacre), Le Clos Joubert, Le Moulin ‎de la Gustais, Le Clos du Pégatine and many others.‎ With its relatively old vines (40 years and older) the grapes are hand-picked, which is very rare in Muscadet. The methods employed in the cellar are similarly painstaking, and produce complex and elegant wines.

The property is located atthe high point of the village of Belvès de Castillon, not far fromDomaine de L’A (the home of Stéphane and headquarters for theteam).The specificity of the area is in relation to the river gravel deposits on theheight of the appellation’s limestone plateau, as well as beautiful marlslopes with southwest and north exposures.Côtes de Castillon became an AOC in 1989 and quickly gainedrecognition for its approachable and easily consumed young wines.The appellation is home to many small, family owned domains that arenestled into the forested hillsides.

Argentina;Bottled in March 2015, the 2014 Estate Selection Malbec seems to have changed its origin to Altamira (but it's not explicit on the label). The wine matured in used 225-liter French oak barrels and cement vats. The nose is ripe and fruit-driven, with aromas of dark cherries and plums plus a subdued minerality and a touch of spices. Most noticeable is the really well-integrated oak (only founder and well-seasoned barrels are used for this wine). The palate is juicy, fresh and has good balance with a somewhat bittersweet finish that is attractive and commercial. This is a great expression of fresh and elegant Malbec from Altamira at a very attractive price point. 130,000 bottles produced.This family winery was created in 2000. They achieved organic certification for their vineyards in Agrelo and winery in Lujan de Cuyo, while they keep working to certify the rest of their vineyards. They have also introduced concrete and egg-shaped vats, oak foudres (3,000- and 5,000-liter) and new vats for the aging of their wines. Yearly output is around 1.5 million bottles. They are advised by Alberto Antonini, who started working here in 2007, because there were many complaints about how oaky their wines were, so their wines might follow the path of his own Altos las Hormigas. In 2009 they contracted with Pedro Parra to better understand their soils. I tasted with winemaker Gabriel Bloise, who explained the change they have been implementing since the year 2010. He's been there since 2006. In 2010 they bought two vineyards in Valle de Uco, more specifically in Altamira. 2014 was a difficult vintage (but nothing compared with the 2015) as it started with frost, Zonda winds, a very warm summer and then rain (I was there in February and they told me it never rains there... and it was raining all the time!). Add to it there is a shortage of Cabernet in that vintage, when it suffered a lot.The Maipe Reserve line sold in the U.S. is marketed in the rest of the world as Chakana Estate (not to be confused with the Chakana Estate Selection). This is confusing, but in the future they want to rename their wines to show the origin, Chakana Luján de Cuyo, Chakana Valle de Uco, Chakana Altamira, etc. Change in progress. Good quality to price ratio in general. I sensed a change in the Chakana wines to more freshness, retained ripeness and better drinkability.

The more that you inhale its perfume the more complex it seems. The palate is full-bodied, quite spicy on the entry but very austere in the middle.

France;"Caz translates to “crazy in a good way,” a sentiment I have come to embrace as I branch out from Bordeaux, bringing you wines from new terroirs. I have been driving through this area for years on my back and forths between St Emilion and Falset. Plot the points between these two places on any map and you can see that I regularly get lost. On purpose, I admit. Crazy as it seems, that’s sometimes how I find new things to do. I can go in any direction, so long as there are good people to work with when I get there. Recently, at a lunch table with friends, we tasted this wine — it was bright, fun, and completely refreshing. The wine totally complimented the food and good, honest farmers grew the grapes. Maz Caz is fermented in steel and left unoaked. The grapes hail from the tippy-toes of the Southwestern Rhône Valley where the attitude and exposition are truly Mediterranean. They live longer down here for a reason. Many people tell the story of falling in love with a wine they had on vacation, and I know exactly what they’re talking about... it’s the moment you taste it: with great friends, alongside great food and no clock ticking. This project seeks to deliver the simple wine: fresh, young, uncorrupted and pure.

The nose is a bit shy at first, but will eventually bloom to show black currant, bittersweet cocoa powder, and sweet saddle leather.

Italy;"The ultimate and purest expression of Barolo can be found in bottles bearing the Giacomo Conterno name. In fact, they represent the ideal of traditional Barolo: rich, powerful, massively structured, and capable of long aging in bottle.<BR><BR>These majestic wines descend from a colossal legacy, spanning three generations of Conternos: Giacomo, Giovanni, and Roberto—in each case, the torch passing from father to son. Both Giovanni, who forged a reputation as the greatest of all Barolo producers, and now his gifted son, Roberto, have continued the important work of patriarch Giacomo.<BR><BR>Roberto Conterno is quick to tell us that the wines he makes belong to his father and grandfather. Yet his era may prove to be the most exciting. After all, Roberto benefits from the wisdom of both Giacomo and Giovanni. And Roberto has shown that he shares not only their genius, but also their devotion to tradition and history. The First Important Barolo<BR><BR>The Conterno crown jewel, Monfortino, is not only arguably the greatest Barolo; it was also the very first Barolo made in what has come to be known as the classic style. At the time that Roberto Conterno’s grandfather Giacomo served in World War I, Barolo was generally sold in either cask or demijohn, meant for early drinking. But in 1920, when Giacomo returned from the war, he decided to create a Barolo with immense aging potential. That wine became known as Monfortino.<BR><BR>Over the next 54 years, Giacomo—and then his son Giovanni—made not only Monfortino, but also Barolo and Barolo Riserva. Each wine was made in much the same way, from purchased grapes, the main distinction being fermentation technique and time in cask. <BR><BR>During the ’40s, ’50s and ’60s, the Conternos could produce their epic Barolos by relying on small, independent farmers who worked their old, low-yielding vines. But by the 1970s, those farmers began increasingly to make their own wines. Threatened with the loss of their fruit sources, Giovanni acquired Serralunga’s great Cascina Francia vineyard. With its fabulous exposure, and predominately calcareous soil, the site was perfect for the powerful Conterno style, and soon Cascina Francia became the sole source of their wines.<BR><BR>Ceretta:<BR>In 2008, Roberto purchased a prime three-hectare section of Ceretta, the famed cru in Serralunga. This was only the second time in the cantina’s history that the family had purchased vineyard land. But Serralunga is a terroir that Roberto knows intimately, as it the home of Cascina Francia. Beginning in the 2008 vintage, Roberto has made both Nebbiolo d’Alba and Barbera d’Alba from Ceretta. But in the future, we can look forward to Barolo Ceretta as well."" -Importer";Piedmont;Red;195.0;14.5;2012 Giacomo Conterno Barolo Cerretta;Nebbiolo;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/99159/bottle/748447/original.png;truffle,   cherry,   plum,   leather and   vanilla;0.75;blackberry,   cherry,   smoke and   earth

Fortune 1621 is the estate's second label. The wine is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, sourced entirely from the property, and made in the same manner as the Darms Lane wines, offering tremendous value for the price. Darms Lane is a small, family-owned estate located in the Oak Knoll District of Napa Valley. The property was planted to Chardonnay vines by Gil Nickel in 1978, and the wines were released under the iconic label Crichton Hall from 1983 until 2004. The 50-acre property in the foothills of the Mayacamus mountain range sits on a bench of clay and Cortina gravelly loam, in the southeastern part of Napa Valley. The vineyard is situated in a windy, cool corridor influenced by the San Pablo Bay, which results in cooler days and nights and contributes to a more elegant, restrained style of wines. The current owner, Larry Bump, became a limited partner of Crichton Hall in 1990, and has been the sole owner since 2002. The inaugural vintage of Darms Lane Cabernet Sauvignon was 2005. Current case production is approximately 2000 cases annually. The vineyard was replanted in 2002 and 2003 to Bordeaux varietals, updating the farming method from conventional to sustainable practices. The vines were replanted with higher density, and the vine training was changed from California sprawl to Cerdon. The estate is currently 14.2 acres planted to Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. The vineyard manager is Doug Wight, and the winemaker (since 1999) is Brian Mox, formerly winemaker at Lewis Cellars and assistant winemaker at Etude.

Born and raised in the historic wine-producing town of Bernkastel-Kues in Germany’s Mosel Valley, Christian’s passion for wine had by then developed into a life’s work. “I have great memories of cultivating the famously steep vineyards and crafting the wine with my parents and grandparents – I have spent more than thirty years absorbing all the details of the winemaking process in and around Bernkastel-Kues.” Nein Lives Riesling grapes are sourced from the Middle Mosel along the banks of the Mosel River in the town of Piesporter. The Middle Mosel is considered the best source of diversity, complexity, and quality grapes within the Mosel Valley. There is no top soil here. Broken shale and schist cover the vineyards and impart the clean, complex mineral quality that has come to distinguish Mosel Rieslings. Riesling reflects terroir better than any other varietal in the world."" - Importer";Mosel;White;8.94;9.5;2016 Nein Lives Riesling;Riesling;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/99638/bottle/748847/original.png;petrol,   flint,   rose petal,   violet,   orange peel,   apple,   pear and   peach;0.75;apple,   pear,   peach,   apricot and   honey

France; “L’enfant perdu” is our secondary wine, without being a typical secondary one. The constellation differs each year, depending on which vineyards are chosen for our top wine, but it always contains all of our four types of grapes, namely Grenache, Carignan, Lladoner pelut and Syrah. Generally our secondary wine consists of two thirds grapes from our younger vineyards which have an age range from 10 to 50 years. Half of this wine is developed in French barrels holding 300-600l and the other half finds its place in concrete tanks. ;Roussillon;Red;21.58;14.5;2013 Domaine Des Enfants Perdu;blend;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/99699/bottle/749011/original.png;vanilla,   toast,   smoke,   tobacco,   dark fruit,   red fruit,   spice box and   cedar;0.75;black currant,   blackberry,   dust,   leather,   currant,   blueberry and   strawberry

United States;The flagship is the 2013 Estate Red Wine, which is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot that spent 20 months in 62% new French oak, with the balance in second fill barrels. Coming from a cooler, higher elevation site on the eastern edge of Walla Walla, this beauty possesses fabulous purity in its cassis and black raspberry fruit, violets, graphite and spring flower-like aromas and flavors. These give way to a full-bodied impeccably balanced 2013 that has fine tannin, nicely integrated acidity and a great finish.

United States;<b>About Etude Wines.</b> Etude was founded on the philosophy that winemaking begins in the vineyard long before the harvest and, that superior grape growing diminishes the need for intervention by the winemaker, resulting in wine that is grown, not made. Pinot Noir of all the classic grapes is the most difficult to make into wine. It mutates easily in the vineyard (a large number of clones have already been identified), is highly sensitive to climate and changes in soil composition, and is unstable during winemaking.;California;Red;17.98;14.0;2015 Etude Pinot Noir Carneros Half Bottle;Pinot Noir;https://dsi2vjvztwiuk.cloudfront.net/website/products/99842/bottle/749089/original.png;barnyard,   cherry,   plum,   game and   tomato;0.375;ripe cherry,   plum,   strawberry,   raspberry and   mushroom
